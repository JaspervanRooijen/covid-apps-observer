Alerts come in quicker than any other apps (without all the ads and other unnecessary forecast info) as well as alerts posted on the NWS website and local tv broadcasts.

Its super obnoxious to get notified constantly of warnings, watches, etc, being cancelled or ending especially if you have multiple counties selected. If this becomes an option, itll be the best weather/emergency alert app available if you're wanting just that and nothing else.

As a volunteer who has been involved in disaster response and recovery for nearly forty years (including over 20 years as Secretary of  my State VOAD), I see some problems with the implementation of Disaster Reporter. The app itself is pretty good, but there are other problems with the way FEMA implemented this project.  Although the photos are almost certainly tagged with the location by the phone GPS when taken, that position information is not included in the data available via the FEMA Disaster Reporter website. The online FEMA map lacks many of the tools we all commonly expect in online maps, such as the ability to click on a point to \"Center Map Here\" and the ability to switch between a road map and a satellite view.  For many photographers, simply the fact that FEMA refuses to properly attribute their photos will be an issue.  The attribution problem arises mostly because FEMA chose not to require (or allow) users to \"create an account in order to submit content.\"  It would have been trivially simple for the developers of the app to include the user's name (or other optional user chosen identifier) in the app.",
