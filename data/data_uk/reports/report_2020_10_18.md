## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

### Description
> Overview
<br>The COVIDCare NI app has been developed by Digital Health and Care NI in partnership with Health & Social Care, the Public Health Agency and the Department of Health.
<br>The app has been designed to help the public in Northern Ireland keep up to date with the latest advice on the COVID-19 pandemic, helping you to:
<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.
<br>Why use the app?
<br>The app is available for use in Northern Ireland to all individuals who are currently residing in Northern Ireland.
<br>Data Security
<br>The app does not collect any personally identifiable information.
<br>We will collect information related to the postcode and age of the user to help us track the impact of COVID-19 in Northern Ireland.
<br>This will help us to plan services and ensure that resources are directed to the areas of greatest need.

> I don't live in NI, and I don't have any covid symptoms but I was curious to see how this app worked, so I used an NI postcode and 'role-played'. This is great; clear and concise, with efficient links through to local health service info. We could definitely benefit from an app like this in mainland UK. Hats off to the developers! To those giving 1 star reviews, I note many of you do not live in NI & did not notice that the app was, therefore, not designed for you!!!<br> :date: __2020-05-27 19:31:24__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |

### Description
> The new NHS COVID-19 app is the Official NHS contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from Coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus.

<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>- Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>- Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>- Check-in: Get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus, using a simple QR code scanner. No more form filling. 
<br>- Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>- Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>- Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Bengali, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Chinese (Simplified), Romanian, Turkish and Arabic (Modern Standard). Additional languages and refinements will follow.
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app.
<br>The App is CE marked as a class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with European Commission Directive 93/42/EEC for class I devices.

> Alright, I mean it does the job but they could of added a scan thing where you scan you and tell if you have Covid but everything else is alright you should really get this app in my opinion Make sure to stay safe guys🤧☺<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:45:23__

> Working as it should! No complaints from me 🤔<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:35:21__

> I had to change my screen width settings on my phone to not be classed as a tablet, so not a 5-star review, but otherwise a decent system. I love how when Google tells you someone who you passed in the street now has tested +ve, the app now sends a second notification saying that the NHS are aware and they don't consider it as a close enough contact. It really reassures me that the makers of the app care about getting it right, and are doing more than the bare minimum as some devs could.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 03:59:27__

> Needs past notification button, I've accidentally swiped notifications by accident so would be helpful if there was a place for them to come through and stay on the app with time /date to help pin point exsposure<br> :date: __2020-10-18 03:30:40__

> Hi I think it's great but I got a notification saying I've been exposed to covid-19 and am wondering if I should isolate or not and how do I get the notification up in the app to show me when the app has scanned.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 03:29:37__

> small issue my battery died and needed to be recharged. app stated i have. to remain isolated until tonight 23.00 hrs now states im fine. not had test results yet. ill still remain isolated but for how much longer i dont know. Single and need to shop as have pets that need food. to.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 02:59:07__

> odd hitch but important to have<br> :date: __2020-10-17 21:59:17__

> Good app, simple to use. However feel it would be better if location automatically updated, as I often forget to change my postcode/don't know the postcode. Would also be good if location would link to information on rules for that area.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 21:21:37__

> Generally pretty good and easy to use. No noticable battery drain. Only issue is the isolation count down. I tested positive on a Saturday (result received following Tuesday) but the 10 day countdown started on the Tuesday, not Saturday as guidelines would suggest. And I checked my account. This gives Saturday as 1st day of isolation So there appears to be a significant fault with the App which just adds to confusion.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 19:43:25__

> works well but had no notifications yet so can't comment on effectiveness<br> :date: __2020-10-17 18:10:16__

> good location helpful staff<br> :date: __2020-10-17 17:25:26__

> No longer opens after 14th Oct update. Google pixel 4a<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:19:00__

> There should be an inbox for notifications. the pop up messages disappear and it is difficult to read them immediately.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:09:53__

> The level in my area is shown as different to the government website!!! When / can this be corrected?<br> :date: __2020-10-18 09:32:11__

> It is an OK app, but it would be better if you could see the notifications again. Once you've clicked off you can't see what it said. This morning I had one that said you've been in close contact, but don't worry. I clicked on the notification and it vanished and now I can't find it to read it properly.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 09:14:19__

> The sort of person who is selfish enough not to self isolate when needed to isn't likely to of bothered with downloading and using this app. Quite then why you've revealed that you'll share info with the police is beyond me. All you've done is hurt the success of the app and give the tin foil hat wearers an energy boost.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 08:47:45__

> Crashing on launch after last update.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 01:40:59__

> I'm a bit confused how so much money has been spent on this app. When you get a notification saying you may have been in contact, you click on it and it disappears. Its really unclear. Could do with a guide/key for all the different notifications you may get. I mean we were taught in primary school always make a guide/key for data someone other than yourself has to use.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 00:17:00__

> means to an end<br> :date: __2020-10-17 23:12:44__

> I mean, I've got it and everything but it's not downloaded any exposure data since Sept 25th so not quite sure how useful it's being for me. Turned off battery optimisation and made sure exposure notifications and Bluetooth is on. Not sure how much more manual fiddling of my Android settings will feel productive.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 22:58:30__

> When you install the app and when you try to set it up, it says you have to be over 16 to use the app. Why do you think is that?<br> :date: __2020-10-17 22:49:46__

> Downloaded app but was unimpressed not as good as I was expecting app deleted<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:43:24__

> Pointless When you work on itu caring for confirmed cases of covid and the app still doesn't notify you it's obvious there is a serious flaw somewhere.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:27:28__

> Not too happy about having to have bluetooth switched on all the time.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:26:32__

> So how long does it take the app to notify you of exposure as I woke this morning to a notification, so unless someone broke in last night, exposed me and left, is this an error? Also when i clicked to read notification, it just disappeared and took me to the app. So I have no idea if I have been exposed or not. Should maybe include a way to read past notifications in the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:25:57__

> Not really that good. I keep receiving notifications telling me I've come in contact with someone that has Covid but there's no information in the app. I receive this notification 4-5 times a day, sometimes at 3/4 am.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:17:20__

> I know there are replies from the department of health to these reviews with regard to the disappearing "potential exposure" pop up, but surely this is fixable by the app developers? I had one of these and only managed to read the first three words before it disappeared for good, leaving me and family in a state of confused shock.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:14:09__

> The False messages about exposure are becoming annoying, both on mine and partners mobile<br> :date: __2020-10-18 09:16:24__

> Fails to scan QR code as I just get a blank screen, wife gets a message telling her where she has checked in. Have reinstalled once and still have same problem.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 09:15:59__

> Still getting notifications of exposure followed immediately by ones saying 'don't worry...', implying it's not actually a correct warning. Absolutely fundamental error, no idea how this made it through QA.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 05:28:21__

> The idea is good. I hope a lot of people will use it. HOWEVER I don't want to find out that I have been exposed to it from a notification which disappears as soon as you click on it and the app doesn't say anything about it. When? Where? How long? If there is nothing I can or should do about it, why notify me? If there is something I can or should do, then tell me in the app. This just worries me and offers no answers or advice.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 03:53:41__

> Was good until they decided to share information with the police. No longer respects your privacy. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:57:52__

> Not allowing you to change your Postcode. Once entered it will not change. And if you go somewhere else it doesn't tell you where you are. GPS not working at all. Not showing if am home or at work<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:49:47__

> total disregard of privacy<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:37:11__

> Showing alerts on my smart watch that weren't on the phone, poorly made! very annoying, will install if I need to go out and about<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:24:00__

> Police access is unacceptable.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:22:59__

> Does its job, however, the recent announcement that the police can access your location data is a gross violation of our privacy and I will now be uninstalling the app. Massive step backwards for public confidence.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:19:54__

> Removing due to the risk of days behind sent to the government. I don't want to be put in a situation where an application but leaves me in a situation where I'm in court. This is not the world I want to live in. Check recent news, where they intend to share data with the police force.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:13:42__

> I was going to install this till I found you have to keep Bluetooth on all the time. I'm not having Bluetooth on all the time to waste my battery power.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 10:11:05__
