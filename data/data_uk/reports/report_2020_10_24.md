## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

### Description
> Overview
<br>The COVIDCare NI app has been developed by Digital Health and Care NI in partnership with Health & Social Care, the Public Health Agency and the Department of Health.
<br>The app has been designed to help the public in Northern Ireland keep up to date with the latest advice on the COVID-19 pandemic, helping you to:
<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.
<br>Why use the app?
<br>The app is available for use in Northern Ireland to all individuals who are currently residing in Northern Ireland.
<br>Data Security
<br>The app does not collect any personally identifiable information.
<br>We will collect information related to the postcode and age of the user to help us track the impact of COVID-19 in Northern Ireland.
<br>This will help us to plan services and ensure that resources are directed to the areas of greatest need.

> I don't live in NI, and I don't have any covid symptoms but I was curious to see how this app worked, so I used an NI postcode and 'role-played'. This is great; clear and concise, with efficient links through to local health service info. We could definitely benefit from an app like this in mainland UK. Hats off to the developers! To those giving 1 star reviews, I note many of you do not live in NI & did not notice that the app was, therefore, not designed for you!!!<br> :date: __2020-05-27 19:31:24__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

### Description
> The new NHS COVID-19 app is the Official NHS contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from Coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus.

<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>- Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>- Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>- Check-in: Get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus, using a simple QR code scanner. No more form filling. 
<br>- Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>- Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>- Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Bengali, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Chinese (Simplified), Romanian, Turkish and Arabic (Modern Standard). Additional languages and refinements will follow.
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app.
<br>The App is CE marked as a class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with European Commission Directive 93/42/EEC for class I devices.

> Update 24th October I've reinstalled the app and it is now not crashing. I will review the stability throughout the week and see if the bug comes back. If it doesn't, I'll update the review to 5*. Kudos to the dev team👍 Keeps crashing when the app opens. It was previously working. I'll update this review every week to keep people informed about whether bug have been fixed/issue resolved. Every time I'll uninstall it and then reinstall. As of 21st of October the issue is still happening.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 09:39:35__

> Get a possible exposure risk message then another saying risk assessment says ok nothing to worry about. How about checking risk first then send relevant message<br> :date: __2020-10-24 09:31:14__

> Could not use any of my other apps. Too big for my phone.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 09:08:27__

> This app NEEDS a check-out option to say you have left a site that you have checked into! To investigate, the time everyone LEAVES a venue, as well as the time they arrive, would save a LOT of unnecessary work! I don't want a legal responsibility to isolate because someone, who checked in after I have left a venue, tests positive! I suppose I can deinstall. Without a check-out feature, how will Track and Trace know whether I had left before the person who tested positive arrived or not?<br> :date: __2020-10-23 22:42:05__

> App is good ish but notifications are a nightmare as u cant open to read them and they dont always come though as have on two phones in the house<br> :date: __2020-10-23 22:26:56__

> Difficult to configure Android mobile to enable QR code scanning. Installation should enable by default. Check in to location in low light does not work because app does not switch on the mobile camera's flash.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 21:18:09__

> I've had test in June was negative but didn't get a code<br> :date: __2020-10-23 20:38:42__

> All items relating to information and links are inaccessable. Each one has a square and a small arrow pointing out from it, when pressed nothing happens.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 20:20:36__

> Good app ,So far ,<br> :date: __2020-10-23 19:37:53__

> The app works, but it stops a load of other apps working properly, such as Hiya, SystmOnline and Airmid UK. Probably not a Bluetooth issue, as other Bluetooth apps don't do this. Then, after about ten minutes, it goes on to block all WiFi access and mobile data access, even though they both still show as "on" and "connected". It's frustrating that I can't use this app and NHS hospital WiFi at the same time. But then again, when did any two parts of the NHS ever work together seamlessly?<br> :date: __2020-10-23 19:24:17__

> You get alerts come up on your phone, yet they aren't stored on the app and you can't read them. When you click on them to read the whole msg they just vanish.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 09:41:12__

> Not that great keep getting messages then go off before even have time to read them pretty much seems a waste of time<br> :date: __2020-10-24 01:04:01__

> I'd like to be able to read the notifications in the app<br> :date: __2020-10-23 20:01:24__

> Important message flashes, you touch it to read and it goes. Just flashed "someone tested positive clo" and I couldnt read the whole thing?<br> :date: __2020-10-23 19:45:24__

> Seems to check at random times, even with bluetooth turned off. Noticed more battery drain than usual. More useful to see area risk than anything else, unfortunately.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 19:13:20__

> Pathetic. When an alery comes in there is no where to read it! I warning message appears in the top notification area, you click on it and it opens the app but there is nowhere for messages! The first few words say don't worry, you have been near somebody.... but what, somebody with Covington? If so where, when? Would be nice to know so I don't go back to that area! Rubbish at keeping you informed<br> :date: __2020-10-23 18:33:16__

> I've received two notifications about a possible close contact with someone tested positive. The notification says that my data (date, time of exposure) has been saved but I'm not able to see this data neither on the notification nor inside the application. I think its important to see that info to know if it was a real contact, when it happens or if its a neighbour, but there is no way to do it. Also, I always go out with my boyfriend, never alone and he has not received any notification<br> :date: __2020-10-23 17:17:50__

> Its OK. But I don't understand why there isn't an option to log when you leave a venue. It appears if I enter somewhere it logs me till midnight or until I log on somewhere else?<br> :date: __2020-10-23 17:05:26__

> Fesperately needs to show notifications on the app itself including a history of when near someone with symptoms. I had 2 notifications within the last 24hrs and because I tapped on them they've disappeared before I had a chance to finish reading them. Please look to add this asap<br> :date: __2020-10-23 16:17:20__

> I appreciate it exists, but this program is far, from perfect. Similar to others, I received the infamous "potential covid exposure" alert, followed by the NHS app telling me that I'm ok, don't worry - and that's it. No extra info, not even a log about the alerts. I know that in the background, on the system level, the tracing works by collecting Bluetooth ids (MAC addresses, probably) from other devices, but this mean what if I'm in a traffic jam, I'll pick up the people around me, regardless of being fairly well shielded from the rest. Apparently the first notification - the exposure one - comes from the system level whenever it makes makes a match against the encountered vs the downloaded and known to be sick database - and sends the alert immediate. The NHS app then dives into the data, and checks the potential distance and exposure time; if it's bad, the app will tell you to self-isolate; if not, you'll get nothing, but another notification, that practically says "false alarm, you're ok". Recommendations to the engineers: - clicks on any of the notifications should take the user to a log of events - these events should have a timestamp at least and, if recorded, a location, about when and where the exposure might have happened - information on why the NHS app decided that this potential exposure is not a risk Without these it's very easy to get stressed and frightened.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 16:14:29__

> Notifications dissapear before you have chance to read; no log or record<br> :date: __2020-10-24 09:42:36__

> Same as others notifications to say exposure, when you click them they vanish. Nowhere in the app to find this information. It's pointless at best!<br> :date: __2020-10-24 09:39:16__

> Got a Covid notification. Clicked on it & it disappeared. Don't know what the message was. I can't see the point in messages that you can't read, so I uninstalled the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 08:10:56__

> Only use it because we are forced to. Why the nhs logo? When can I put my negative result in?<br> :date: __2020-10-24 08:02:12__

> Random pop ups about being in close contact with a Covid +ve person and no further details about it. Been to Sainsburys at 4 in the afternoon and pop up comes in at 23.30! Not useful at all!<br> :date: __2020-10-24 08:00:37__

> Notifications are not held in the app. I got a notification and clicked on it and the notification disappeared. . But have no idea what it said as I cant find the message in the app. I see previous review responses say that if it was important the app would tell me. I feel the app should still show me the message so I know what it was trying to say even if it was a safe message.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 07:55:37__

> You have to click on the app to get a notification.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 06:59:27__

> Worst app ever, if there was an alternative would definitely use instead of this. First issue, you can check-in to a location, but no option to check-out when you leave it, second and biggest issue, messages only show in notification bar, if accidentally dismissed, it's gone forever. Should at the very least be able to view the message from within the app, or better yet, have the ability to view the history of messages with dates and time.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 05:10:24__

> Awakened at 1am with a message telling me that the risk level nearby has changed. A three year old could write better software.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 01:46:40__

> Can't even see if I'm safe going to school stupid<br> :date: __2020-10-24 01:23:59__
