## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-05-03 17:07:02__

> It's good that this information is available in one location, however please note (developers) that the physical distance required by law and for the best chance of avoiding the virus via breath, is 2 metres, not 1 metre as stated in the app. Sorry to be picky, but this is crucial information. As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. üè≥<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

> Virus checker (McAfee) alerted to a (possible) malware contained within this app. After reading other reviews of this app it appears to be a false positive, thank goodness other people had flagged this as i would of halted the install and not downloaded it. I don't believe its actually anything harmful contained within the app itself. I would given the app a 5 ‚≠ê except its laid out like a website from 1992. Great app though<br> :date: __2020-05-21 09:29:34__
