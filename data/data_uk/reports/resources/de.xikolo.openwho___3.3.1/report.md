### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br>

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
