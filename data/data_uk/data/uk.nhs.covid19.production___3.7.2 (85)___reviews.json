This should be made easy to do, imho, but I cannot find out how to do this. _______ _______ UPDATE: I have since had an email from a developer and can confirm that I am now able to extract the data I wanted. On a HP20 Pro this can be done by: 1) Go to Settings 2) Choose Google 3) Click on COVID-19 Support (Exposure Notifications) 4) Click on \"Exposure Checks\" 5) Click on the 3 dots in top-right corner and choose \"Export exposure checks\" This will output in JSON format (I chose to email it to myself for ease-of-access). Import into something like Excel and parse data. This enabled me to see how many checks had been done, and to confirm that the matchesCount was zero. I hope that is of some help to any others wanting to find out how to do the same thing.",

Yesterday I updated this app with my positive test result code, and still - nothing on my husband's phone. I have no confidence in this app at all!",
