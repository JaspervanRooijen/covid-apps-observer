There's not even an option to add a place using the GPS tracking, it has to have a bar code poster. The vast majority of supermarkets, shops etc don't have tracking because it's voluntary, but since the governments track and trace doesn't work well now does it matter? And they've said 'data won't be used for other things' is not true.",
