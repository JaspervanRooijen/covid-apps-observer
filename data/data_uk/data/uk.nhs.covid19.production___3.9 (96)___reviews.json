Much is mysterious. It should include info (animations etc) if what happens if you test positive, or someone you're in contact with is. Apparently you can't enter a negative test result to stop the mysterious countdown that some claim you get but it doesn't tell you about until you do. Disappointing.",

I've been checking in whenever I go anywhere and that part at least does work, but this morning I received two alerts literally within seconds of each other. The first alert told me my movements had been reviewed and I had nothing to be concerned about, the second alert told me that someone I had been near has reported a positive Covid-19 test. The problem was that both alerts had been truncated and ended in three dots (...), so I tapped on each alert expecting to see more information only to find that the app opened up and there were no further details and indeed no history of alerts so I have no idea when or where I might have been exposed (to Covid). I'm aware that you can recall a notification from the Notification Log on Android but that only returns the text from the original truncated notification. What use is a Covid-19 warning app that doesn't tell you anything? I'll wait and see if this is addressed in a future update but if it's not then it seems pointless keeping it on my phone. Reply to app developer. I was dissappointed to receive what appears to be a canned response to my review, it would appear that you either didn't read my review properly or you do not take my comments seriously. Either way you undermine and devalue what could and should be an important tool in the fight against Covid-19. Much needs to be done to improve this app and bring it up to the world beating standard once promised by Boris Johnson..",

I clicked on the alert notification and was sent to the app for more information, but there was no further information. I can see from a number of other uses that apparently, Google randomly sends alerts/messages to confirm the app is working. Also, if there was an issue, there would be information within the app. Surely an NHS app can't allow Google to send false positives as a \"check it works\" validation. Firstly that is very worrying for people. Secondly, it seems the app keeps crying wolf too many times which will surely take away the trust people have in it. And on to the app itself. I can't see where I have scanned in or visited (it is my data, I should have access to it). I also would expect that if I have a correct alert, it tells me where the incident was, at what time and when the other persons symptoms started to show. Reason, I mostly drive and don't have contact face to face. So there could be an incident alert come up and it is down to me sitting next to someone else in another car at the traffic lights and this has triggered me as being close to them. In reality, this situation poses low risks. But without that information, I am left to worry, have a test and spend up to two weeks worrying even more about possibly another cry wolf situation. I hope the app keeps getting developed as something like this is very important to a lot of people, and if the right people work on it, could prove invaluable.",

The responses given by the developer are not helpful and only add to the confusion. Why can't these notifications be shown in the app with a clear and specific explanation that you do or do not need to self isolate? How many people have self isolated unnecessarily after receiving this notification? The design of the app is also poor. it's not the top priority to look pretty, but the poor UX is hampering it's effectiveness.",
