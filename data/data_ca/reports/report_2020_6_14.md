## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access approximate location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by Alberta Health Services. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Well designed app that has had no adverse effect on battery life! When I first got it I was force closing it when not out to conserve battery. I decided to test leaving it on 24/7 and over two days I couldn't see any extra battery consumption. I was honestly shocked and have left it on since. Also really like that this app DOESN'T use GPS only my Bluetooth to see who I've been in contact with instead of tracking my every movement.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 00:40:09__

> Very important and we'll designed application, privacy is protected and will help keep spread under control<br> :date: __2020-06-02 04:31:45__

> Very " nice " Thanks !!<br> :date: __2020-05-26 04:25:34__

> Installed & activated on Samsung S9 without any issues. Runs fine. There is extra battery usage, but it's tolerable for me.<br> :date: __2020-05-25 03:53:49__

> Amazing app, feels so good to know the government knows all. I cannot wait for the vaccine. Please increase my taxes and fund more the media.<br> :date: __2020-05-25 03:45:04__

> Easy to install. Not noticing any power drain and analysis agrees. Bluetooth speaker works fine at same time. Reminds me to turn bluetooth back on when I shut off for a phone call not to be via my bluetooth speaker.<br> :date: __2020-05-24 18:39:00__

> Great idea except for the power usage. The only way to stop is is to go into the app's app setting and "force stop" it to turn it off when I'm at home. It's easy enough to turn it back on again by tapping the app icon. But this is a hassle.You should be able to just pin it and minimize it when you need it to run in the background, and close it when your at home.<br> :date: __2020-05-24 10:44:48__

> Does it work in Ontario too??<br> :date: __2020-05-23 14:18:59__

> Seems to be working. If you don't drink the kool-aid, and stay away from Apple this works just fine. I have not even noticed any battery drain on my Android phone.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 02:12:06__

> Have downloaded this on both my mom's and my phone (Samsungs), and haven't had any problems. It only asks for bluetooth to be turned on and for you to enter a phone number to contact you should you encounter someone who later tests positive.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 02:11:24__

> Greetings to anyone who reads this, If the app is only getting a 3.0 (3 Stars), is there a problem with it? Please consider the following, none of which is/are (a) conspiracy theory/theories. I can say this because countless independent studies done across the world have all found these phenomena to be true. 1. Are delusional naysayers about the Covid-19 pandemic keeping the app from scoring higher by not subscribing to it? ; or 2. Is the low rating the possible result of most of the current subscribers not getting alerts, and that others - who haven't (yet) subscribed to the app - are being lulled into a false sense of safety, even complacency? ; or, 3. Is the app a bit of a lame-duck technology - on the part of the government - and the app is not functioning properly or at all? ; or, 4. Are Albertans simply complacent about the pandemic? Go into any store which has clearly defined and labelled "shopping lanes" and other forms of signage, along with PA and public service announcements exhorting shoppers to abide by the store's rules and Alberta Health's guidelines, and you'll experience first-hand what I'm talking about. Indifference, obtuse behaviour, willful or blind ignorance, etc. ; or, finally (at least for now) 5. Is the media, which continues to feed us only what is "news worthy" to it (as it has done for nearly 3 generations), the real problem? If the app is not being kept in front of viewers or in the ears of listeners, is that the reason for the low rating? The media, along with government, controls the access to news. More often than not, it's the media doing this because "news worthy" really means that which attracts and is supported by the most lucrative advertising revenue streams. As CFCN says "All the news you need to know", which translates, "All the news we want you to hear". CBC, CTV, and the American networks on cable and satellite TV are all complicit in this. I'll stop now, since I've run out of time to continue. However, I must add that if the government is truly engaged in leading Albertans out of this tragedy, it will not alter, delete, expunge, rephrase, or in any other way, edit my comments because some of them have suggested government shortcomings. I'm keeping a copy of this for my own files and for posterity. Clayton Walls, Calgary June 11, 2020 @ 1300 h MDT<br> :date: __2020-06-11 21:00:38__

> I think the idea is great as long as it's executed properly however there seems to be a glitch with the app as it's used 33% of my battery so far today.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 03:45:04__

> I noticed the last 2 days this app has been draining my battery. Use to have 45% left at bedtime, now only 10% at 1 pm. Just did the update, which I didn't know about. So hopefully it fixes this battery issue.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 21:54:26__

> I don't need data on to run it. And it doesn't drain my battery despite having Bluetooth on . So far so good<br> :date: __2020-05-23 03:41:32__

> Same as others have said, works fine, installed fine, just wish there was an on /off button for scanning. I can't turn my Bluetooth off because I wear a smartwatch, and I don't need the app when I'm not leaving my house or going anywhere that I will not be in contact with other people. It is a bit of a hindrance having to go in and out of settings all of the time to enable the app permissions, please just add a button to this app.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 00:18:05__

> Won't know if it works till it's needed. Hopefully never. Always has a 1 superimposed on the icon, but nothing apparent when I open the app.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 20:40:40__

> I was totally surprised on how much this app draws dowm my battery , worse than f-cebook app, will be definitely removed once things cool down ...<br> :date: __2020-05-15 00:48:59__

> Good app and hopefully it gets installed and used more. Like others are saying, it needs and off button because of the battery drain when using it at home. Most people are at home now so this should be a feature available....<br> :date: __2020-05-12 17:49:39__

> Installed easily and seems to work fine.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 00:44:52__

> No problems, but also I don't get any feedback about whether I'm near another person with the app, so I can't verify whether it's actually doing anything.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 18:46:13__

> Install was very easy. Done in under 2 minutes. App is a great idea for the times. Having said that, yes the battery drain is amazing. Started as a 5 but now a 3. I wish it was more.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 01:17:26__

> The principle is good and I'd really like to help by using this app but a week after installing it, my battery is drained before the afternoon is over. I have to uninstall. When the developers can make it more efficient in power usage I'd be happy to install it again<br> :date: __2020-06-09 23:39:11__

> I've had no complaints up until a couple of days ago when my phone indicated that AB Trace Together has been using 35.6% of my battery, while at home. I disabled Bluetooth and it didn't change or conserve the battery. My phone has been on for 20 minutes this morning and its already used 6.1% of my battery. Prior to this, battery usage was negligible. Updated it and hoping that helps.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 16:52:26__

> I so want to help by having the app but the battery drain is frustrating to deal with. At the start a few weeks ago it seemed like there was no issue but over the past two days, after going out twice, my battery is just kaput in an outrageously short period of time. I'm talking from full charge down to 10 percent in a span of 7 hours, of which 5 of those hours was spent being in battery saving mode and idle. I hope the update fixes this or retaining this app will be untenable.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 06:21:14__

> Drains battery life.<br> :date: __2020-06-07 11:01:03__

> Uses so much battery. I normally go through 75% battery on an average day and with this app I have to recharge half way through the day. 10 days running<br> :date: __2020-06-05 06:36:35__

> A little trouble with the 2 Step Verification Code.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 22:27:35__

> It's quite respectful of privacy, and uses very little of the battery on my Pixel 3. But please start supporting the new Google and Apple contact tracing API! Since it isn't user friendly on iPhones, less iPhone users will use it, and then it's less effective for us Android users too. What essential worker with an iPhone would leave their phone on for an 8-hour shift? I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't such a deterrent to iPhone users.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 15:18:24__

> Does not send activation code.<br> :date: __2020-06-02 14:59:12__

> Phone - Essential PH-1 I don't know if it's just me, but my phone heats up quite spectacularly, draining the battery. The app also has huge buttons and small text, and literally has a huge button saying NEXT----> with small text above it saying don't press unless asked to. I haven't used it long enough to get any results, but with the issues immediately apparent, I don't recommend it.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 06:37:14__

> This app was fine for a few weeks then all of the sudden started eating the battery life. No idea why. I had to uninstall because I was no longer making it through the work day with enough battery.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 11:48:28__

> Just got a notification from my cell "some apps or processes are overloading the system (CPU) and need to be closed." Then this app was specifically shown with CPU usage at 20.66%. I had to uninstalled the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 04:20:54__

> Great idea except you should probably make it available to all phones. I know a number of people who want to download the app but can't because it's not supported on their phone<br> :date: __2020-06-02 03:32:37__

> It was fine until 3 days ago when it went from draining 1% of my battery to >80%. Can't track anything if my phone is dead by 9am. I had to uninstall until this is fixed.<br> :date: __2020-05-31 02:36:09__

> I installed this app, however it was causing issues with some of my other apps and they would not load so I had to uninstall. Once I uninstalled everything else worked fine. Unfortunately the app is not going to be very effective unless more people use it and with all the issues people are having with it fewer people will be using it. I hope you are able to find a solution to those issues and relaunch an app that will be effective. I may consider reinstalling after it is fixed.<br> :date: __2020-05-29 22:39:00__

> Had to uninstall, this app is a battery eater.<br> :date: __2020-05-25 01:17:19__

> Was running fine for the first couple of weeks but in the past 2-3 days battery consumption has become intolerable.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 03:37:20__

> I downloaded it on my android phone and it worked okay, but the battery drain is horrible as noted by lots of other users. I was also irritated that despite the fact that they say it only uses bluetooth, location services had to be enabled as well or it wont work. Uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 13:44:22__

> Destroys your battery. I now have to charge my battery 3 times a day because of this app. It's insane how much battery it uses.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 07:57:16__

> You may want to look at power usage. Depending on how close I am to another phone? my phone chews through its battery. Sitting with my wife at home and in less than 5 hours, it ate through 45% of my battery. Prior to the installation of ABTraceTogether, I never used my battery up in a day; sometimes would get two days. It is also heating my phone up due to excessive battery usage. Please resolve this issue so I do not need to uninstall the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 22:03:04__

> I'd like to support this app but recently it's been killing my phone's battery. Looking at the details it's 94% of my battery life.<br> :date: __2020-06-07 06:02:28__

> Need a start stop button to turn off when home with out having to go to settings. , burns battery and data.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 00:35:52__

> ABtrace app no good at all this technology can go this far, what a shame!? Terrible dev app!! I signup successfully. Next step is provide abs covid19 information I don't have that. There is no map pop-up say covid19 nearby same like how urber car has like graphic cars moving around without asking abs covid19. And why we need to use bluetoorh it will drainage all the battery.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage.

<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
