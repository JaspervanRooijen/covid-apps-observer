## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access approximate location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by Alberta Health Services. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications

> Contact tracing using technology is an obvious and effective way to fight the covid-19 crisis. Well done!<br> :date: __2020-05-09 07:37:24__

> Thank you all for your service!!!<br> :date: __2020-05-09 00:57:11__

> I havent experienced any problems or crashings, during registration. So far, it is a good app! My only question is, how reliable is this app?<br> :date: __2020-05-08 06:02:30__

> The app runs in the background. For those worried about battery drainage, turn off Bluetooth when in your home. I hope this will help AHS deal with COVID19<br> :date: __2020-05-08 00:04:13__

> Easy to install and no noticeable battery drain ... thanks Alberta<br> :date: __2020-05-07 20:11:05__

> Great work getting it created quickly!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 05:20:38__

> Doesn't send the code,now works<br> :date: __2020-05-06 01:18:23__

> Good app. Doing my part to help feels good. Also the more people download this the better the app will work.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 21:36:13__

> Works as advertised.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 20:30:59__

> Works great, but why location? The whole point of the contact tracing API developed by Apple & Google was to facilitate contact tracing without the need for location access. Even from the app description: "The app uses Bluetooth to log contact with other individuals[...]" and "Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by [AHS]". SO WHY DO YOU NEED LOCATION? Please update explanation. Edit: Per AHS website & Android docs, location required for Bluetooth. Please update this in description.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 16:53:18__

</p>

> Overall, same as other reviews. Installs and runs smooth. The issue is the constant "on" state, with you needing to disable Bluetooth to effectively disable the battery draining searching for other Bluetooth devices. It would be nice to just have a button to click to enable when I leave the house. No need for it to be on when at home, but I'd like to use my headphones please. Thanks!!<br> :date: __2020-05-09 04:44:38__

> The daily power consumption is high. It never runs in the background. Hopefully the next release will reduce per consumption.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 21:57:57__

> Works as expected. Have not experienced issues with high battery usage. The app has used about 1% over the entire day while the phone is off the charger. Using a Samsung Galaxy S10. Data usage - it has used just under 1 MB in the 4 days installed. 4 stars because the app gives a constant notification that it is in use, but you can't swipe it away. I turned notifications off and will to turn them on when I am out. The app should have a badge system based on consecutive days stayed home!<br> :date: __2020-05-08 00:58:51__

> Easy to install. Would be better if it had a way to pause scanning when just at home.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 01:00:27__

> Obviously I haven't had to use the upload feature and haven't been contacted, so no comment on those features, but installation and verification went smoothly. It has been running issue free over a weekend.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 15:41:13__

> Had troubles getting the code at first, had to delay getting this set up by a day, but got it installed now so maybe they worked out some bugs. Won't really know if it's working unless I get an alert or something. More for their use than mine but I hope it works.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 14:14:38__

> It runs just fine in the background and doesn't seem to have any affect on battery<br> :date: __2020-05-04 04:14:09__

> So far, so good very little power drain on the cell. I like the privacy options. Especially the deletion of all my data at my request when this pandemic is over.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 20:03:18__

> Seems to be working fine. Was easy to set up. The only thing I dislike is that it keeps a notification open 24/7 when usually I make sure I've dealt with and gotten rid of all notifications. I'll get used to it, I'm sure.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 16:31:41__

> Downloaded fine / easy to set up. I'd like to see how many downloads have happened.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 15:57:03__

> No experience. Just hope it works, it will kill me if I get it with my health issues<br> :date: __2020-05-09 06:18:52__

> Used 50% if the battery on my S9 in half a day and I never left the house. Good idea but bad implementation. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:50:50__

> Keeps resizing my phone wallpaper. Never had this issue till I downloaded this app.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 18:32:34__

> OK. But it should record any time you're within 2m of another. Not just waiting for 15 minutes. Only takes a second to catch the virus.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 00:15:20__

> Finally got it loaded. The app requires Android 8+ to run so I had to go to my play phone, Copy an image of TWRP to it, Copy an open source zip of Android 10 to it, copy a zip of Opengapps to it, flash the recovery with TWRP, use TWRP recovery to wipe the phone and flash Android 10 and the basic Google apps, then configure the phone and install the app. I took two days to plan it rather than risk bricking the phone. Could they simply have ported to more revisions of Android?<br> :date: __2020-05-07 03:51:29__

> Constantly trying to pair with my laptop even when it's already paired and connected via Bluetooth.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 16:46:32__

> What is the point if IPhone users can't run their version of the app in the background. No IPhone user is going to have the app running in the foreground with their screen on. Because of the sheer volume of iPhone users this makes the android app pointless.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 13:09:07__

> I don't like the notification that has to be present at all times but oh well. My main complaint is that this app needs to be compatible with older model smartphones. My mother is older and has an older phone as I'm sure many older people do. She now can't use this app even though seniors are the most at risk.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 23:04:32__

> Had to get code four times because, even though I entered the correct number, it told me either the number was wrong or did nothing at all. Had to press other keys multiple times to get it to advance. Annoying. Hope it works better than the set up.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 03:06:42__

> Just downloaded it last night, so no valid remarks yet. I'll update when I have something useful to say.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 22:26:36__

> Good intentions, but battery hog! This thing is a background app, so why does it use the most battery of any app? It sucks up 150% of the battery compared to apps I do actively use a lot! Dead phones don't trace -- they'll need to address this in order to get people on board.<br> :date: __2020-05-09 22:03:36__

> Worked for a few days now won't let me upload. No one sends a text either.<br> :date: __2020-05-09 00:22:08__

> Couldn't install in my Android 6.0 phone.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:38:53__

> Great idea but the app eats battery life to the point where I need to charge in the middle of the day. I got a message regarding my phone needing to shut down software that vanished once I deleted the app. I want to use the app but it just requires to many resources.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:48:17__

> Easy to install. However drained my battery in a very short time. Fully charged in the morning down to 15% just before noon. Not practical.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:43:14__

> I wanted to continue using this app, but unfortunately it eats up too much of my battery- the first day that I had it installed, my phone died after only a few hours with hardly using my phone and settings showed it was majorly consuming power. Had to uninstall!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 14:02:19__

> Not everyone here has a N.A. area code...<br> :date: __2020-05-06 10:40:58__

> No off switch for when you are staying home. High battery usage.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 01:50:10__

> Having an issue where it seems to constantly trigger my laptop to try and pair with it. My phone beeps every couple of minutes and no way to prevent it short of killing the app (or switching off bluetooth). If the devs want to contact me to find out what's happening feel free.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 00:17:53__

> Yes it probably tracks you to see if you have come into contact with someone sick. But drains your phone battery.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 23:50:23__

> Drained my battery! Downloaded the app yesterday, woke up & my phone was dead. For functionality of Covid-19 tracing, don't we need an app that won't kill off our battery so we can be reached?<br> :date: __2020-05-09 14:08:50__

> Installed the app on two different S8 phones but had to remove because of excessive battery use. Would kill the battery overnight. Battery usage showed between 40% and 70%. This has to be fixed before I will reinstall.<br> :date: __2020-05-09 00:17:55__

> Battery hog! While the app has good intentions it is a major battery hog. Uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:15:09__

> Public health is important so an app like this could really help, but having it use Bluetooth drains peoples batteries quickly and the constant notification is very annoying. There are also privacy concerns of course<br> :date: __2020-05-08 20:19:40__

> The symptom tracker needs some improvement. I have moderate to severe asthma so I regularly have symptoms like difficulty breathing & coughing. I also have seasonal allergies so sneezing & sinus issues are common for me right now too.

To fight pandemic, more thorough epidemiology study is necessary for Canada. Also, about mask, from personal opinion, protecting the community is just as important as protecting personal.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
