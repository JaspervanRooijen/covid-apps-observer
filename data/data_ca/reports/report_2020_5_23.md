## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access approximate location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by Alberta Health Services. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Copyright 2020 Government of Alberta

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Seems to be working. If you don't drink the kool-aid, and stay away from Apple this works just fine. I have not even noticed any battery drain on my Android phone.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 02:12:06__

> Have downloaded this on both my mom's and my phone (Samsungs), and haven't had any problems. It only asks for bluetooth to be turned on and for you to enter a phone number to contact you should you encounter someone who later tests positive.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 02:11:24__

> Unlike others here, my experience is that this app's battery usage on my S9 is very minimal. That is with Bluetooth always being on. I suspect that some people are misreading their battery usage. The problem with having a manual on/off switch is that you will forget to turn the app back on when you go out. My only criticism is that Alberta has not done enough to encourage the public to use this app. As of this writing, there have been only 50,000 downloads.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 18:24:21__

> I hope more and more people will download this app so that we can try and get ahead of this virus. But there's been too many people out there with the conspiracy theories that this is not real problem is when in your lifetime have you seen everything practically shut down its app for essential Services? It hasn't happened. And giving them your upload of where you've been that day. As it stands any Dr. Can look at your WHOLE medical history.just do it ppl!!<br> :date: __2020-05-22 00:40:38__

> Battery drainage not an issue for me, everything works fine. (Galaxy S9)<br> :date: __2020-05-17 21:23:06__

> Seems to work fine on my galaxy note 9. See notification from time to time and thats it. Haven't seen any changes in phone performance and no one for AHS has called. So... happy about that.<br> :date: __2020-05-17 19:52:27__

> Works well on my pixel 3. No issues.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 02:32:19__

> Will not send 6 digit code.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 03:08:34__

> Running on a Huawei P30 Lite with Android 9 patched to latest. App runs fine and I don't notice any battery drain issues. However, I find that the app self-terminates regularly. I see this when I wake the phone up without entering the password - the status screen shows that the app is running or not. Starting it up is easy - just go to the apps page and start the app again. It's good for anywhere from 1 to 3 days before it dies again. This app seems to strike a decent balance between privacy and usefulness.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 00:57:07__

> Battery drain bluetooth issue fix: you do NOT have to disable bluetooth to disable the app, although this is the easiest and fastest method. The other method is to disable location permissions for the app under apps & notifications tab in phone's settings. This disables the ability for the app to use bluetooth. Another method would be to uninstall the app altogether lol<br> :date: __2020-05-13 00:11:47__

> I don't need data on to run it. And it doesn't drain my battery despite having Bluetooth on . So far so good<br> :date: __2020-05-23 03:41:32__

> Same as others have said, works fine, installed fine, just wish there was an on /off button for scanning. I can't turn my Bluetooth off because I wear a smartwatch, and I don't need the app when I'm not leaving my house or going anywhere that I will not be in contact with other people. It is a bit of a hindrance having to go in and out of settings all of the time to enable the app permissions, please just add a button to this app.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 00:18:05__

> Won't know if it works till it's needed. Hopefully never. Always has a 1 superimposed on the icon, but nothing apparent when I open the app.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 20:40:40__

> I was totally surprised on how much this app draws dowm my battery , worse than f-cebook app, will be definitely removed once things cool down ...<br> :date: __2020-05-15 00:48:59__

> Good app and hopefully it gets installed and used more. Like others are saying, it needs and off button because of the battery drain when using it at home. Most people are at home now so this should be a feature available....<br> :date: __2020-05-12 17:49:39__

> Installed easily and seems to work fine.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 00:44:52__

> No problems, but also I don't get any feedback about whether I'm near another person with the app, so I can't verify whether it's actually doing anything.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 18:46:13__

> Works as advertised, used 0% to 1% of battery daily. A must have with the reopening strategy as it will make it easier to stop a second wave and stop the spread. Smart way to prevent a second closure....<br> :date: __2020-05-11 07:36:00__

> Overall, same as other reviews. Installs and runs smooth. The issue is the constant "on" state, with you needing to disable Bluetooth to effectively disable the battery draining searching for other Bluetooth devices. It would be nice to just have a button to click to enable when I leave the house. No need for it to be on when at home, but I'd like to use my headphones please. Thanks!!<br> :date: __2020-05-09 04:44:38__

> The daily power consumption is high. It never runs in the background. Hopefully the next release will reduce per consumption.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 21:57:57__

> Draining my battery. Did not seem to start until about 1 week after installing it. Sadly had to uninstall.<br> :date: __2020-05-18 07:52:49__

> Battery consuption is way too high. Currently 13% on a day when I was only out of my house 1 hour. App needs to detect home WiFi and stop scanning unless it detects no wifi. It is the third largest app draining my battery. Not acceptable. May have to discontinue use.<br> :date: __2020-05-17 06:56:45__

> I haven't noticed any drastic battery drain on my device yet but as others mentioned the app should be able to be turned off as 95% of my time is spent in my own home. People are more likely to use the app if they don't feel that they don't need it 95% of the time but rather have the option for the 5% of the time it could be helpful.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 16:32:13__

> It's fine but battery draining lately. Seemed to run pretty efficiently in the background at the start but I'm charging my phone 3 times a day now.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 06:52:48__

> Please add an "off" button. I shouldn't have to keep the app running while I'm sleeping or just sitting at home. Turning off bluetooth is not an "off" button since this app isn't the only thing that people use bluetooth for. I don't mind the battery drain since it's a useful app and I think the battery drain, when I want to use the app, is worth it. Would rate 5 stars if you had an off button.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 22:42:27__

> No experience. Just hope it works, it will kill me if I get it with my health issues<br> :date: __2020-05-09 06:18:52__

> Used 50% if the battery on my S9 in half a day and I never left the house. Good idea but bad implementation. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:50:50__

> Keeps resizing my phone wallpaper. Never had this issue till I downloaded this app.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 18:32:34__

> OK. But it should record any time you're within 2m of another. Not just waiting for 15 minutes. Only takes a second to catch the virus.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 00:15:20__

> Finally got it loaded. The app requires Android 8+ to run so I had to go to my play phone, Copy an image of TWRP to it, Copy an open source zip of Android 10 to it, copy a zip of Opengapps to it, flash the recovery with TWRP, use TWRP recovery to wipe the phone and flash Android 10 and the basic Google apps, then configure the phone and install the app. I took two days to plan it rather than risk bricking the phone. Could they simply have ported to more revisions of Android?<br> :date: __2020-05-07 03:51:29__

> Was running fine for the first couple of weeks but in the past 2-3 days battery consumption has become intolerable.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 03:37:20__

> I downloaded it on my android phone and it worked okay, but the battery drain is horrible as noted by lots of other users. I was also irritated that despite the fact that they say it only uses bluetooth, location services had to be enabled as well or it wont work. Uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 13:44:22__

> Destroys your battery. I now have to charge my battery 3 times a day because of this app. It's insane how much battery it uses.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 07:57:16__

> I've had this app installed for a few weeks, this weekend I noticed battery usage of 13.3% in two hours. I did a phone reboot, recharged and tested again. Battery use at 15% for this application, I have removed the app until this issue can be resolved.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 19:00:10__

> Good intentions, but battery hog! This thing is a background app, so why does it use the most battery of any app? It sucks up 150% of the battery compared to apps I do actively use a lot! Dead phones don't trace -- they'll need to address this in order to get people on board.<br> :date: __2020-05-09 22:03:36__

> Worked for a few days now won't let me upload. No one sends a text either.<br> :date: __2020-05-09 00:22:08__

> Couldn't install in my Android 6.0 phone.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:38:53__

> Great idea but the app eats battery life to the point where I need to charge in the middle of the day. I got a message regarding my phone needing to shut down software that vanished once I deleted the app. I want to use the app but it just requires to many resources.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:48:17__

> Easy to install. However drained my battery in a very short time. Fully charged in the morning down to 15% just before noon. Not practical.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:43:14__

> I wanted to continue using this app, but unfortunately it eats up too much of my battery- the first day that I had it installed, my phone died after only a few hours with hardly using my phone and settings showed it was majorly consuming power. Had to uninstall!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 14:02:19__

> It is utilizing too much battery (39.5%) which is causing me to have to plug in my phone every 4 to 6 hours.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 02:00:50__

> As so many others are reporting on social media, I tried multiple times but no code was sent to my number. Update: Tried again and it worked, but uninstalled it after it had an undismissable notification when I turned off my Bluetooth when I got home and then stopped working when I turned off push notifications so it would stop doing that. Clunky design.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 04:05:47__

> One rating is for the attempt.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 02:08:48__

> Here's a tip; if my device can see yours via Bluetooth, there's a good chance I can access your device and everything on it using an apk like Superblue. Don't be an idiot. This is exploitable Traceware.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 16:42:56__

> I'm scratching my head wondering if they even tested it out.. First off, I have an older phone (Galaxy S7)), connected to a watch and headphones, adding another connection, especially the way this app works, my battery won't last 2 hours I go through a 20000mah power bank in a day using this app. Also this whole Covid thing is over-exaggerate it's a nasty flu but we will build immunity to it. Shutting down the economy has devasting after-effects. There's an ulterior motive at play..<br> :date: __2020-05-21 13:47:36__

> The Bluetooth connectivity was good for the app but it blocked out the ability to use Bluetooth calling, Bluetooth headsets and most other Bluetooth capabilities. This should have been more tested before rolling out. If your devices are unable to play to Bluetooth units Uninstaller this app to get your functionality back. Poor programing.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 18:05:05__

> For the time I had the app installed, it was a constant drain on the battery as well as always dropping the connection. Would start the app and within 5-10 minutes the app would drop. Open another app, the app would drop/stop. Uninstalled, for a tracker this was useless. I've had fitness trackers that work better than this.<br> :date: __2020-05-17 22:59:37__

> My wife's phone is only a year old and she is unable to install this app. She gets this device isn't compatible... really I am a software developer and have a decent idea what's involved... I can understand maybe not supporting really old phones but that clearly isn't the case here. Most older people which let's be honest are people that might need this app the most have older technology. A ball has been dropped here.<br> :date: __2020-05-17 21:02:30__

> I deal with the public all day so I thought the idea behind the app was great. Knowing you could reach out to anyone I had steady contact with if I ever got sick gave me peace of mind. However, it drains my battery so quickly that I have since deleted the app. I can't have a phone that won't work when I need it to because my battery has died.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 20:04:56__

> Installed without activating the app. After giving it some thought I uninstalled it. I do not trust the current Wildrose Party aka UCP government with unlimited data access. It's easy to see by the number of installs how many Albertans feels the same as I do. I will stay with the simple Federal government app for reporting daily conditions. No name, phone number required. Location only.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 16:22:48__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It would be great if we also can see the map with active cases only. This would be very helpful.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 22:57:22__

> The symptom tracker needs some improvement. I have moderate to severe asthma so I regularly have symptoms like difficulty breathing & coughing. I also have seasonal allergies so sneezing & sinus issues are common for me right now too. If I check these things off on the symptom tracker, it automatically assumes the worst even tho I don't have any other common symptoms like fever, haven't traveled, or been in close contact with know Covid cases. The app doen't ask about pre existing conditions.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 16:13:33__

> App is okay but why so many updates? I tried it and now another update! Also I'm going to boycott mostly products made in china. Personal Skincare! I think the app should make people aware to buy Canadian & American made products! That should be an app! Is anyone listening?<br> :date: __2020-04-24 19:02:31__

> It is definitely improving! But with limited population to update the data, the investigation won't give effective guidance. To fight pandemic, more thorough epidemiology study is necessary for Canada. Also, about mask, from personal opinion, protecting the community is just as important as protecting personal. Though regular masks can't sufficiently protect individual, but they can protect others around positive individual. Strongly suggest everyone to put on mask in the public during COVID.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 06:29:54__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage. 
 **android.permission<br>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to write to external storage.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
