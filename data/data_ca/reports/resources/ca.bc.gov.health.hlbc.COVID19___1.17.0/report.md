### Description
> If you are a resident of British Columbia, Canada, BC COVID-19 Support is designed for you to stay informed about COVID-19 in BC and determine what actions and next steps you should take.  Recommendations are personalized and based on your personal risk factors.  You will receive timely updates with important news and alerts from BCâ€™s Ministry of Health.  Recommendations and content are automatically updated based on the latest BC guidelines related to COVID-19.
<br>This application has been developed in collaboration with Thrive Health, a Vancouver-based healthcare technology company.  
<br>SAFETY & SECURITY:
<br>You will only be asked to provide your age, postal code, and device location.  The data you provide will be combined with all user data and used to inform the provincial COVID-19 response, and to allow you to receive location-based alerts.
<br>Your data will not be sold. Your data will not be used for any purpose other than health care.
<br>We follow industry best practices for data security and privacy.  The data you provide is always encrypted and is stored in Canada.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Your app keeps opening Google Chrome for news updates. However, I don't use this browser. Can you update the app to support any browser? Android has Firefox, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, and many more - you need to support more than just Chrome. Once this is fixed, the app will get 5 stars! Edit: you guys fixed it!! Thank you! 5stars to you!<br> :date: __2020-05-16 08:10:54__

> Perfect<br> :date: __2020-04-28 11:09:46__

> Informative!<br> :date: __2020-04-25 04:26:38__

> This app helps with understanding what to do, what is going on, and what the government is doing.<br> :date: __2020-04-25 02:28:31__

> Would be nice if date/time of public TV updates posted on home page.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 23:34:19__

> Great<br> :date: __2020-04-24 03:48:09__

> Very well made, intuitive, and provides exactly the information needed during this time. As a bonus, the app is very respectful of privacy settings, and has location turned off by default. Highly recommend using this app to keep up to date with the current situation in BC.<br> :date: __2020-04-16 12:46:31__

> This app is very nicely done<br> :date: __2020-04-07 17:37:19__

> Thank you for this app. Please include a graph of active cases in BC, if possible. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 16:21:41__

> I'm a hypochondriac, or so my therapist tells me. This app is great for me, I just had some bad gas last night and thought it might be covid-19, i researched and saw that some people get diarrhea which really worried me cause i didnt buy a ton of toilet paper. So i sat in my study until 3 am worried I was going to suffer from extreme pooping I was just glade I had my study washroom sanitized in the morning. I found this app dug right into it, went thru the self assessment and I'm ok. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 01:06:59__

> I note that no mention is made as to where and how to obtain masks. Pharmacies are out of stock. Where can masks be obtained?<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:16:56__

> Very helpful and informative.<br> :date: __2020-04-25 00:50:33__

> The updates are now fixed and the app works well, thank you for updating, this helps track a lot of issues in the Hospice home I would also like to see a better breakdown of the daily check up a quick check up and a thorough check up option would be very sufficient but very well done app specially for proper information<br> :date: __2020-04-13 20:17:45__

> This important part of life right now, I like to hear of many changes that I come in to hearing for better or worse Thanks sandy davies<br> :date: __2020-04-08 23:01:32__

> It's pretty easy and basic didn't keep it for long I just keep the news on tv<br> :date: __2020-04-07 02:48:49__

> Very helpful and informative particularly for British Columbians. Presented in a way that is clear and easy to digest. A "survival guide" that doesn't come across as all doom and gloom. Daily stats could be updated more frequently but overall very helpful.<br> :date: __2020-04-07 00:36:59__

> Good app, but could use some enhancements such as a dark theme (app is blindingly white) and a widget that provides updates on cases in real time. Also, app survey is focused solely on symptom related material and nothing in regards to the actual app...<br> :date: __2020-04-05 23:00:40__

> Clear and easy to use<br> :date: __2020-03-24 05:10:56__

> I think you need to add a prompt to set up the location. I'm happy to have this app. Tx<br> :date: __2020-05-13 09:24:24__

> Stats are nice but the self assessment tells me to call 911 if I'm feeling confused.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 06:05:32__

> Nothing really new or informative that is not available elsewhere.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 18:19:05__

> Doesnt provide the best charts to track trend/progress....new cases and deaths daily<br> :date: __2020-04-10 07:06:36__

> Good info so far, but the app is not updated daily with current stats. Typical gov't I guess.<br> :date: __2020-04-04 17:07:08__

> I like it so far. I think we should see a provincial breakdown map by region. Use the self-check and government data to populate the map.<br> :date: __2020-03-27 06:58:15__

> The assessment needs a better breakdown of symptoms. For example there are ways to distinguish between whether you are just experiencing seasonal allergies or actual Covid 19. Adding a few more questions would improve the value of the assessment and people will be less skeptical of its accuracy.<br> :date: __2020-03-24 21:21:54__

> Never any updates, no clarification of who should stay off work, and an online test that only says stay at home for 10 days if you're sick. As useless as the BC government's reaction to the whole mess. People should be fired.<br> :date: __2020-03-24 20:35:26__

> Worse than useless. This self-assessment app went in circles without giving me ANY symptoms info. As 78yr old with a 5yr bowel condition waiting now for over a year in a congregate care home for a scheduled post-surgery 2nd colonoscopy behind a parachuting army of folks with possible CANCER and now Covide19, I find the several dead-end links you offer to old or sickly folks to self-assess, frankly, cruel. Their end sums up my entire site experience: "PAGE NOT FOUND. PLEASE take it down.<br> :date: __2020-04-25 14:04:20__

> Great resource until recent update...now inaccessible on our devices. At a time when you we should be enabling access to appropriate info the app is now limited to due to browser requirements.<br> :date: __2020-04-07 21:44:05__

> Terrible app. Never gets updated and gives out of date advise. Makes you wonder what else the BC Goverment is mismanaging during the COVID crisis.<br> :date: __2020-04-03 04:30:17__

> Can't use it anymore. Says browser needs to be updated (not true as far as I can tell)<br> :date: __2020-04-01 01:43:55__

> Useless!<br> :date: __2020-03-29 17:02:48__

> Keep having to uninstall and reinstall<br> :date: __2020-03-29 07:38:58__

> Useless<br> :date: __2020-03-28 22:47:40__

> Some very minimal resources and suggestions for managing symptoms. A flashy way to be told to call the nurses line, for basically any scenario. Just call 811 and save your time.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 05:25:51__

> I'd love something that started with a daily update straight from the province. Maybe a color coded system like fire warnings that is clear and actionable. What IS social distancing? Which businesses are supposed to be open? Which are deemed essential? How often should someone be at a grocery store? Make this easy.<br> :date: __2020-03-25 07:31:11__

> It would be appreciated if I could know where the cases are.i think that is what people want to know.<br> :date: __2020-03-24 19:44:38__
