## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Well there is no DOT. to put in your temperature. Like 96.9 F do we write 97 F? Or 97.4 F we round it off to 97. This has to be fix. Something as simple as this should not be in the Beta testing phase.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 20:42:30__

> Basic app. I wish they hooked it to googles contact tracing by bluetooth, that would make it 5 stars for me. And i would be much happier. Its nice to have the numbers that easy to see but i don't think it gets updated often enough<br> :date: __2020-07-21 05:16:26__

> Daily reporting even if you don't have symptoms is good data.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 17:22:16__

> Pretty basic, wish this worked with the COVID tracking that was installed on my phone by Google. Also, I set the reminder for daily at 9am and it has only reminded me maybe 2-3 times since installing, which was 10-14 days ago.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 16:45:19__

> No local info. Weak app.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 14:47:23__

> slow to load and transition from page to page.<br> :date: __2020-06-16 02:26:59__

> Good app for COVID19 Info but no tracing portion<br> :date: __2020-06-09 22:22:43__

> This app has not updated stats since June 5th. My app is up to date. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-06-08 11:05:14__

> Stopped giving reliable notifications with latest version. No app exit stratagy, that's very poor design. Otherwise fine app.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 13:51:15__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-06-01 22:47:52__

> Very disappointed. No Bluetooth integration. Kind of a fail, not completely but close.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 18:07:44__

> On the surface the app appears to do what it claims. I will update my review once I've had a chance to inspect the code for myself and do some testing of my own.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 23:34:48__

> Dont like it<br> :date: __2020-07-04 07:09:53__

> Can't get it to load update ? But phone gets jammed regularly in this ongoing hostage scenario.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 01:51:24__

> The Johns Hopkins website has much more current data about Canada, which is disconcerting. Otherwise it's nothing but advice to stay home and wash your hands. Good advice, but no data = not useful. Edit: Kept it on my phone in case it became more useful. It didn't. Have now deleted it.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 16:44:33__

> Good Not great but thank you!<br> :date: __2020-04-18 01:02:10__

> You are missing the most important number The number of resolved cases People seeing the number of cases where people have pulled through gives us hope<br> :date: __2020-04-14 12:41:43__

> Quebec count is incorrect<br> :date: __2020-04-08 01:31:08__

> This app hasn't updated any data since I installed it on March 2nd<br> :date: __2020-04-05 02:18:04__

> Need info on all infected on the map, like in Korea<br> :date: __2020-04-02 18:15:02__

> Installed app twice, loads first time and then crashes every time after that.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 22:46:07__

> Useless. The app doesn't take advantage of contact tracing making this just an alternative for information and basic surveys which the government could have had on a website.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 21:35:15__

> Very bad app. Features an embedded website for stat tracking.........<br> :date: __2020-07-24 03:45:34__

> Doesn't support contact tracing, at least Google says so in the settings.<br> :date: __2020-07-08 14:48:53__

> Useless<br> :date: __2020-06-25 06:52:28__

> I have used this before. I have location on, googles scanning service for wifi location also on. When I open it, it takes me to a white page with the BC logo and states there is an app error. I am confused because there seems to be a seperate app for BC anyway yet thats what is happening and have not got past the error message to try and correct it to Ontario<br> :date: __2020-06-24 00:06:53__

> Useless, I wanna see if there is any case in my neighborhood<br> :date: __2020-06-19 19:08:58__

> This app is 100% garbage and a waste of time to install! I wouldn't have voted 1 star but google actually insist that users vote at least 1 star.<br> :date: __2020-05-29 04:43:57__

> Do not download this app, this is another step Justin Trudeau and his communist government are taking to create a policed state. What the government is doing is quite draconian. I would not trust the government with so much power, because at some point it will be abused!<br> :date: __2020-05-23 13:04:17__

> Haven't used yet i hope it is more truthful than the canadian health minister who said masks were not needed because covid wasn't very contagious when documents prove she knew she was lying. There is an app with 2 million users posting their symptoms but can only get what our government wants us to think.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 05:43:47__
