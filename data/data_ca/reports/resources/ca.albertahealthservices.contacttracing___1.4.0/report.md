### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>‚Ä¢ Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>‚Ä¢ Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by Alberta Health Services. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Copyright 2020 Government of Alberta

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of the Province of Alberta |
| **Website**  | [http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether](http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether) |
| **Email** | ABTraceTogetherSupport@gov.ab.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [3720 - 76 Avenue Edmonton, AB T6B 2N9](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3720%20-%2076%20Avenue%20Edmonton,%20AB%20T6B%202N9) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app gives me comfort that if I become infected, all of those with the app that have been around me will get notified. Nothing leaves my phone unless I get sick and then voluntarily download it. (Watch the video on the website) You are more protected and helping to protect others if you have the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 02:25:50__

> I have a 3 years old phone & I've had no problem with my battery. When keeping Bluetooth on, in a 12 hour period the battery usage was only 0.7%. My only complaint is that it shows an icon in my status bar regardless if Bluetooth is on or off. Personally I would prefer that the icon only shows when Bluetooth is off. Until we get the National app here at least it's one thing I can do. Who knows when we'll get the National one!?! Hopefully sooner than later!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 04:37:30__

> I like to have the App to protect myself. I feel more confident wherever i go knowing that if iam exposed to the virus i will be informed immediately and that way i can be tested and get the treatment i need. Thank you<br> :date: __2020-09-02 08:15:09__

> Seems to work fine. Unfortunately it is set to "Canada only" so my sister cant install it on her US phone despite living here.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 03:29:29__

> Battery drainer. The only way to reasonably use the app is to turn it on around others. Otherwise, not a "set it, forget it" solution. The overall function of the app is clearly explained, and is fine to use when needed. No crashes, flawless app persistence.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 02:23:44__

> It doesn't drain my battery like others say. Not sure why others are having issues...?<br> :date: __2020-08-17 21:50:04__

> No issues with the app (Samsung Note 9).<br> :date: __2020-08-10 04:24:28__

> needs an off button holy moly I believed all the battery drain hype, especially since I'm a server at a restaurant I just leave my phone plugged in at the front desk and it's not a problem (heats up a bit tho). when I get home however it's worse because it was charging all day consuming power-at-will. the choice for me is to turn off background activity on the app in the settings when I get home. there's no sense in exchanging keys with my fam 24hrs a day. but I could easily forget it off :/<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:46__

> I noticed the last 2 days this app has been draining my battery. Use to have 45% left at bedtime, now only 10% at 1 pm. Just did the update, which I didn't know about. So hopefully it fixes this battery issue. (03-Jun-20). UPDATE: After the update the app no longer drained my battery. I noticed a drain on my battery again today (06-Jul-20) and checked for an update, which there was. If you notice your battery being drained, just update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 16:07:00__

> Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent). Great idea just needs to be optimized a bit more.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 06:33:13__

> Huuuge battery drainer.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:41:00__

> I'm tired of being asked if I'm ok. Why am I asked multiple times a day? Is it because I'm around or could have contact exposure? Asking me multiple times a day is causing me anxiety.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:17:15__

> App is useless when I am travelling outside of province. Alberta, SWITCH TO THE FEDERAL COVID APP!!!<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:28:19__

> It is probably not the apps fault but I live in b.x. now and could never understand it .. stay safe<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:11:04__

> It has been a good app for now.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 05:20:33__

> It's irritating that it has a large notification on my screen all the time to note that it's running, rather than an icon, or the option to just run in the background without that. Worse, it drains my battery, using as much power as almost everything else I run combined. I'd like to use it, but this isn't feasible.<br> :date: __2020-08-27 01:11:47__

> Extreme battery usage on a Pixel 2. Want to keep it don't know what to do<br> :date: __2020-08-20 06:30:42__

> Please listen to everyone and make an on/off option. This only needs to be on when we go out in public and will just be an added step such as bringing a mask.<br> :date: __2020-08-11 05:33:38__

> It's neither good or bad. It just sits in the background. I can only assume it works.<br> :date: __2020-07-20 08:28:08__

> I appreciate the effort Alberta made to get this out so quickly, but it's time to switch the Federal system which is more reliable, comprehensive, and easier on my battery. Uninstalling as there not enough people using this anyway.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 04:03:34__

> There hasnt been any action on here<br> :date: __2020-10-07 17:02:38__

> Horrible app drains battery. Also ineffective. Please create a National app uses Google / Apple API<br> :date: __2020-10-05 23:15:57__

> How are supposed to trace the virus if the app is not compatible with older Android version .you need to have at least Android version 8 . That's very not smart.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:00:04__

> It's an absolute battery drainer! The intentions are good and the existence of it is important but it's just killing my battery and my phone is brand new.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 04:21:04__

> The idea behind this is great. But the implementation eats battery like candy. And there's no way to temporarily turn it off. I'd love to be able to turn it off while I'm driving or when I'm backpacking in PLUZ areas no where near another human. So because my phone having battery is more important when I'm in the middle of no where I'm uninstalling.<br> :date: __2020-08-19 17:33:47__

> This things drains battery real quick<br> :date: __2020-07-26 18:48:34__

> Takes way too much battery life. 39% over 4 hours....<br> :date: __2020-07-08 22:16:47__

> Can't connect to car without uninstalling. Ridiculous as it intereferes with other bluetooth so how can I even use it. Can't use it if I need bluetooth.<br> :date: __2020-07-08 03:36:51__

> I barely go outside, so all it did was eat my battery throughout the day. Even if I went outside, I never got a notification from the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 11:08:43__

> While well intended, this app is useless. First of all it depends on the person with a positive test to voluntarily upload this information. Secondly, shouldn't a person with a positive test be self isolating for 14 days, in which case he/she shouldn't be exposed to anyone. I would be surprised if this app has actually registered exposure to anyone. This app needs more work. I'm uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 06:52:38__
