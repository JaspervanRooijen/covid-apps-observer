## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Health Canada | Sant√© Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Health+Canada+%7C+Sant%C3%A9+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Health+Canada+%7C+Sant%C3%A9+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Pretty basic, wish this worked with the COVID tracking that was installed on my phone by Google. Also, I set the reminder for daily at 9am and it has only reminded me maybe 2-3 times since installing, which was 10-14 days ago.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 16:45:19__

> Can't get it to load update ? But phone gets jammed regularly in this ongoing hostage scenario.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 01:51:24__

> The Johns Hopkins website has much more current data about Canada, which is disconcerting. Otherwise it's nothing but advice to stay home and wash your hands. Good advice, but no data = not useful. Edit: Kept it on my phone in case it became more useful. It didn't. Have now deleted it.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 16:44:33__

> Useless<br> :date: __2020-06-25 06:52:28__

> I have used this before. I have location on, googles scanning service for wifi location also on. When I open it, it takes me to a white page with the BC logo and states there is an app error. I am confused because there seems to be a seperate app for BC anyway yet thats what is happening and have not got past the error message to try and correct it to Ontario<br> :date: __2020-06-24 00:06:53__

> Useless, I wanna see if there is any case in my neighborhood<br> :date: __2020-06-19 19:08:58__

> This app is 100% garbage and a waste of time to install! I wouldn't have voted 1 star but google actually insist that users vote at least 1 star.<br> :date: __2020-05-29 04:43:57__

> Do not download this app, this is another step Justin Trudeau and his communist government are taking to create a policed state. What the government is doing is quite draconian. I would not trust the government with so much power, because at some point it will be abused!<br> :date: __2020-05-23 13:04:17__

> Haven't used yet i hope it is more truthful than the canadian health minister who said masks were not needed because covid wasn't very contagious when documents prove she knew she was lying. There is an app with 2 million users posting their symptoms but can only get what our government wants us to think.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 05:43:47__

> Daily check in suddenly stopped working<br> :date: __2020-04-29 23:12:54__

> Can someone tell me how this app was already to go as fast as March 30? Telus can't even get my optik tv app right and they have all the money in the world. So how can the gov have one that works so quickly ?<br> :date: __2020-04-28 06:08:24__
