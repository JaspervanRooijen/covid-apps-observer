In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I like the fact that you've jumped on board with making an app for this situation I give you two thumbs up it is informative but needs to have a little more<br> :date: __2020-05-05 03:39:19__

> Good app! I am NOT impressed with how the classes keep changing to keep BC and AB in the same class! They are NOT having similar numbers, no matter how the classes are changed!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 21:13:09__

> cool app. would be cool to zolm in on an area to see where the hot spots are. infected people.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 04:37:01__

> It would be great if we also can see the map with active cases only. This would be very helpful.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 22:57:22__

> The symptom tracker needs some improvement. I have moderate to severe asthma so I regularly have symptoms like difficulty breathing & coughing. I also have seasonal allergies so sneezing & sinus issues are common for me right now too. If I check these things off on the symptom tracker, it automatically assumes the worst even tho I don't have any other common symptoms like fever, haven't traveled, or been in close contact with know Covid cases. The app doen't ask about pre existing conditions.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 16:13:33__

> Meh<br> :date: __2020-04-29 21:35:56__

> Would like to be able to see what the stats collected by the app in total are showing but does not seem to be available? 🤔<br> :date: __2020-04-28 18:52:32__

> Please start using Bluetooth for contact tracing Check out the 'traceCovid' app<br> :date: __2020-04-27 22:27:20__

> App is okay but why so many updates? I tried it and now another update! Also I'm going to boycott mostly products made in china. Personal Skincare! I think the app should make people aware to buy Canadian & American made products! That should be an app! Is anyone listening?<br> :date: __2020-04-24 19:02:31__

> It is definitely improving! But with limited population to update the data, the investigation won't give effective guidance. To fight pandemic, more thorough epidemiology study is necessary for Canada. Also, about mask, from personal opinion, protecting the community is just as important as protecting personal. Though regular masks can't sufficiently protect individual, but they can protect others around positive individual. Strongly suggest everyone to put on mask in the public during COVID.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 06:29:54__

> I havent really used this app much to give an opinion<br> :date: __2020-04-22 03:00:51__

> Show how many have recovered please I want to know<br> :date: __2020-04-20 17:37:02__

> Completed update and my archive data is gone. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-04-18 06:41:40__

> The Johns Hopkins website has much more current data about Canada, which is disconcerting. Otherwise it's nothing but advice to stay home and wash your hands. Good advice, but no data = not useful. Edit: Kept it on my phone in case it became more useful. It didn't. Have now deleted it.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 16:44:33__

> Good Not great but thank you!<br> :date: __2020-04-18 01:02:10__

> You are missing the most important number The number of resolved cases People seeing the number of cases where people have pulled through gives us hope<br> :date: __2020-04-14 12:41:43__

> Quebec count is incorrect<br> :date: __2020-04-08 01:31:08__

> This app hasn't updated any data since I installed it on March 2nd<br> :date: __2020-04-05 02:18:04__

> Need info on all infected on the map, like in Korea<br> :date: __2020-04-02 18:15:02__

> Haven't used yet i hope it is more truthful than the canadian health minister who said masks were not needed because covid wasn't very contagious when documents prove she knew she was lying. There is an app with 2 million users posting their symptoms but can only get what our government wants us to think.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 05:43:47__

> Can someone tell me how this app was already to go as fast as March 30? Telus can't even get my optik tv app right and they have all the money in the world. So how can the gov have one that works so quickly ?<br> :date: __2020-04-28 06:08:24__

> None<br> :date: __2020-04-27 01:28:16__
