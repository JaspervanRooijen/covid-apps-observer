## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access approximate location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by Alberta Health Services. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Copyright 2020 Government of Alberta

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I have a 3 years old phone & I've had no problem with my battery. When keeping Bluetooth on, in a 12 hour period the battery usage was only 0.7%. My only complaint is that it shows an icon in my status bar regardless if Bluetooth is on or off. Personally I would prefer that the icon only shows when Bluetooth is off. Until we get the National app here at least it's one thing I can do. Who knows when we'll get the National one!?! Hopefully sooner than later!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 04:37:30__

> I like to have the App to protect myself. I feel more confident wherever i go knowing that if iam exposed to the virus i will be informed immediately and that way i can be tested and get the treatment i need. Thank you<br> :date: __2020-09-02 08:15:09__

> I have not had any problems at all aside from the battery drain which I solved by turning off my Bluetooth at home and turning it on while I am out.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 00:29:04__

> I like this app because it will inform me if I've been in contact with anybody that has this virus because I definitely do not want to get it thank you<br> :date: __2020-07-31 20:43:34__

> Battery drainer. The only way to reasonably use the app is to turn it on around others. Otherwise, not a "set it, forget it" solution. The overall function of the app is clearly explained, and is fine to use when needed. No crashes, flawless app persistence.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 02:23:44__

> It doesn't drain my battery like others say. Not sure why others are having issues...?<br> :date: __2020-08-17 21:50:04__

> No issues with the app (Samsung Note 9).<br> :date: __2020-08-10 04:24:28__

> needs an off button holy moly I believed all the battery drain hype, especially since I'm a server at a restaurant I just leave my phone plugged in at the front desk and it's not a problem (heats up a bit tho). when I get home however it's worse because it was charging all day consuming power-at-will. the choice for me is to turn off background activity on the app in the settings when I get home. there's no sense in exchanging keys with my fam 24hrs a day. but I could easily forget it off :/<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:46__

> I noticed the last 2 days this app has been draining my battery. Use to have 45% left at bedtime, now only 10% at 1 pm. Just did the update, which I didn't know about. So hopefully it fixes this battery issue. (03-Jun-20). UPDATE: After the update the app no longer drained my battery. I noticed a drain on my battery again today (06-Jul-20) and checked for an update, which there was. If you notice your battery being drained, just update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 16:07:00__

> Greetings to anyone who reads this, If the app is only getting a 3.0 (3 Stars), is there a problem with it? Please consider the following, none of which is/are (a) conspiracy theory/theories. I can say this because countless independent studies done across the world have all found these phenomena to be true. 1. Are delusional naysayers about the Covid-19 pandemic keeping the app from scoring higher by not subscribing to it? ; or 2. Is the low rating the possible result of most of the current subscribers not getting alerts, and that others - who haven't (yet) subscribed to the app - are being lulled into a false sense of safety, even complacency? ; or, 3. Is the app a bit of a lame-duck technology - on the part of the government - and the app is not functioning properly or at all? ; or, 4. Are Albertans simply complacent about the pandemic? Go into any store which has clearly defined and labelled "shopping lanes" and other forms of signage, along with PA and public service announcements exhorting shoppers to abide by the store's rules and Alberta Health's guidelines, and you'll experience first-hand what I'm talking about. Indifference, obtuse behaviour, willful or blind ignorance, etc. ; or, finally (at least for now) 5. Is the media, which continues to feed us only what is "news worthy" to it (as it has done for nearly 3 generations), the real problem? If the app is not being kept in front of viewers or in the ears of listeners, is that the reason for the low rating? The media, along with government, controls the access to news. More often than not, it's the media doing this because "news worthy" really means that which attracts and is supported by the most lucrative advertising revenue streams. As CFCN says "All the news you need to know", which translates, "All the news we want you to hear". CBC, CTV, and the American networks on cable and satellite TV are all complicit in this. I'll stop now, since I've run out of time to continue. However, I must add that if the government is truly engaged in leading Albertans out of this tragedy, it will not alter, delete, expunge, rephrase, or in any other way, edit my comments because some of them have suggested government shortcomings. I'm keeping a copy of this for my own files and for posterity. Clayton Walls, Calgary June 11, 2020 @ 1300 h MDT<br> :date: __2020-06-11 21:00:38__

> I think the idea is great as long as it's executed properly however there seems to be a glitch with the app as it's used 33% of my battery so far today.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 03:45:04__

> I don't need data on to run it. And it doesn't drain my battery despite having Bluetooth on . So far so good<br> :date: __2020-05-23 03:41:32__

> It's irritating that it has a large notification on my screen all the time to note that it's running, rather than an icon, or the option to just run in the background without that. Worse, it drains my battery, using as much power as almost everything else I run combined. I'd like to use it, but this isn't feasible.<br> :date: __2020-08-27 01:11:47__

> Extreme battery usage on a Pixel 2. Want to keep it don't know what to do<br> :date: __2020-08-20 06:30:42__

> Please listen to everyone and make an on/off option. This only needs to be on when we go out in public and will just be an added step such as bringing a mask.<br> :date: __2020-08-11 05:33:38__

> It's neither good or bad. It just sits in the background. I can only assume it works.<br> :date: __2020-07-20 08:28:08__

> Only installing for long periods of exposure It seems to cause overheating with my phone. If I have the app installed (paused or unpaused) it seems to ramp up internal temps. Also, there should be an option to say you are at home, so you don't have to pause the app. The constant need to have BT on, even while at home, is annoying. I get why but it is frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 00:54:11__

> I uninstalled the ap due to high battery usage from the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-28 21:23:04__

> I'm sure this a great service to use. The only issue I have is having Bluetooth on all the time. It drained my battery by 60% in 10 hours while I was at work. I'm out in the community a lot, so I would need to keep it on for it to be useful.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 16:41:45__

> Battery killer, but worth running if you can. Please add support for Androids "COVID-19 exposure notifications"<br> :date: __2020-06-20 22:25:38__

> I would have really liked to use this to help out but my battery life is non-existent. I just got a new S10 and my battery died a little over halfway through the day. If they could somehow fix this app to turn off when you're not moving or something then maybe it wouldn't drain your battery so bad?

> The idea behind this is great. But the implementation eats battery like candy. And there's no way to temporarily turn it off.

> While well intended, this app is useless. First of all it depends on the person with a positive test to voluntarily upload this information. Secondly, shouldn't a person with a positive test be self isolating for 14 days, in which case he/she shouldn't be exposed to anyone.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Retired computer programmer here. I've reviewed the Apple-Google algorithm this app is based on and this app has excellent privacy. For those asking excellent questions about why it does not give more information about what is going on in your area, or why it does not link to your Contacts, the answer is privacy. This only know your province if you decide to manually tell it that info. Beyond that it has no idea where you've been or when you've been. Girl friends, boy friends, bars, clubs, moonlighting jobs, strange churches, political groups -- whatever -- this app does not know and cannot tell. People wanted privacy, that is privacy! Similarly with contacts. All the app knows are the random numbers of different phones it has been within 2 meters of for 15 minutes or more (I think they can adjust that). No names, no telephone numbers, no nothing that can identify people. Again, people wanted privacy and that is what we have here, privacy! Symptoms other people have in the area? Two parts to that: 1. One is that the symptoms of other people in your area might not be the symptoms you'll have. If it told you what symptoms other people in your area had this week -- the mismatch between them and you could cause you to ignore you infection until it is too late. Better that you simply be notified to call your provincial medical help number, and they can discuss with you any symptoms you have already and what to do next. 2. Privacy. The more questions the app asks, the more privacy-oriented people will complain. And you think they won't complain? People will complain about anything. If not something that concerns them, then they'll steal the 'agency' of someone else, steal their voice, and complain on their behalf. For example: a. People are complaining it won't work on phones more than 5 years old that do not have Bluetooth. It is not their phones they're worried about, it is "other people's phones, old folks, indigenous people, poc, etc." b. I'm an "old folk". Most of my fellow oldies have new phones, purchased 1 or 2 years ago when CDMA and GSM networks stopped working. I've heard of one senior whose phone is too old. And her phone is so old she can't get a signal sitting in a coffee shop 1/8 of a mile from a cell tower. Half the towers or more just do not carry the frequency for her old G3 phone. We seniors are able to stay home much more easily. We have our CPP (and hopefully a second pension). We don't have to go out to work. A lot of us are in nursing homes. We have less need for this app than people who are out and about working with the public and socializing with strangers. Covid contact is less a problem for us than the endless loneliness. c. Indigenous people, poc, disabled -- I fit in here and again I'm unhappy about others stealing our agency and speaking for us. There complaint is based on the old dangerous stereotype of white people saying non-white people are all poor. They are not all poor. And those that cannot work due to disability or do not work due to children, are generally like us seniors, they have an easier time of sheltering at home. d. I would be more worried about the working poor who deal with the general public. Race, sex, gender, and whatever does not come into it. +++ Those who are working poor and doing jobs like sale clerk or ticket taker -- coming in contact with dozens of strangers every day -- maybe those people should be given phones by the government. But that is not an issue with this app; that is something separate for the government to do. +++ e. THIS IS THE MAIN THING: An app that would provide notifications without using Bluetooth would have to trace our movements to work. There would be no other way. It would have to invade everyone's privacy. +++ This app is not perfect in everyone's opinion. No app will ever be perfect in everyone's opinion. BUT this app delivers maximum privacy while still doing the job of notifying us of covid contacts with minimum overhead load on our computers. +++<br> :date: __2020-08-04 08:56:31__

> Stopped giving reliable notifications with latest version. No app exit stratagy, that's very poor design. Otherwise fine app but becoming very slow to load or change tabs. Edit: 2020-07-29 COVID-Alert beta not available for download in eastern Ontario?!?<br> :date: __2020-07-29 21:53:24__

> Well there is no DOT. to put in your temperature. Like 96.9 F do we write 97 F? Or 97.4 F we round it off to 97. This has to be fix. Something as simple as this should not be in the Beta testing phase.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 20:42:30__

> What if the point of this app? It gives generic information on a wide basis. How can I determine if my specific area is affected. I know the province numbers may be up but that does not address our regional breakdown. I found this app to be completely useless and unnecessary.

> We were instructed to install this to help with contact tracing. 2 months after install i was prompted to install another app called covid alert, meaning that I was using this app for nothing... the functionality should have been integrated as one app not two. It's a waste of taxpayers money to do development this way.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 20:06:36__

> Irresponsible app. This is NOT the tracker app. Get that app instead. I thought I had the tracker app when I'd installed this app BUT I WAS WRONG. This app should not be in the Google Play Store (anymore)! There should be only one Government of Canada app. This app should be merged with the other app! Update. If I could give this app a negative I would. It just generated a notification for 'acts of kindness'.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
