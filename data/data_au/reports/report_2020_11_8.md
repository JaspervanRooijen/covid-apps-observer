## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Australian Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app#covidsafe-app-help](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app#covidsafe-app-help) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space.

> How can this app be using more than 41% of my phone's battery??? This is ridiculous<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:14:29__

> I really like the idea of this app if it actually worked... But it doesn't. It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 02:07:56__

> I don't get codes will I need two get scanning or anything else if you'll be pretty please do something about this I will be gripple<br> :date: __2020-10-26 06:36:18__

> I'd been using this OK for months and (probably after an update) I discovered it was asking for location access and no battery optimisation. Having allowed those, it started draining the battery - 27% one day. I removed it, rebooted the phone and reinstalled the app. So far so good today. About 5th in the list of battery users at 1.8%.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 06:28:19__

> Be nice to have a simple way to close the app when you're home.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 00:57:45__

> It's a good idea. However I know several young people who believe that the app could be used to track whether they are breaking COVID restrictions so they won't download. Govt should guarantee noone will be prosecuted based on info from the app. Would increase use.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:05:21__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Migration Council Australia |
| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |
| **Email** | info@migrationcouncil.org.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Now that you remember frequent guests (eg, my husband) it takes under 5 seconds to check in. Great job.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 02:09:59__

> Good job Canberra! This is more in line with the privacy requirements than signing a sheet of paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 02:40:40__

> Works really well, much better than using a google form<br> :date: __2020-10-06 11:10:27__

> Easy to use but don't just scan QR and expect app to open. The QR does nothing but open a website, thats what they mostly do. Scanning a QR will just take you to website to download. It will not open app. Once I downloaded app and added my details, I clicked check in and then I scanned the QR (after giving app permission) Easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:41:02__

> Quick and easy to use, really good!<br> :date: __2020-09-27 10:53:21__

> Much quicker and easier to use than scanning a QR code to click to load a website and manually entering your details. Better security is a plus too, it'd be hard to tell if random QR code is linking to a legit website or not.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 06:20:23__

> Good!<br> :date: __2020-09-18 08:06:04__

> Very easy to use and intuitive. Looks clean and professional too.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 01:49:59__

> Samsung GS7 will not scan QR code. App has camera permission enabled. Phone will scan QR codes, but not in this app. Fixed! Thanks! App now returns "Not a check in CBR code" on invalid QR scans<br> :date: __2020-10-02 04:18:26__

> Complete failure. Says enter code but no indication of where to get code.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 00:06:22__

> This app does not work. I've tried at 3 different locations and it has not worked once. Scanning a QR code and entering details manually was far easier. So now have to use written sign in if available or not bother signing in (playgrounds)<br> :date: __2020-10-27 04:01:35__

> Poorly implemented solution. Clunky / inconvenient to use. Uninstalled it immediately after using it for the first time.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 07:41:15__

> Have tried to scan a couple of times and it hasn't worked. Uninstalled and reinstalled. See how it works then.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 12:14:32__

> Doesn't even download<br> :date: __2020-10-07 11:17:45__

> Didn't download while I was at the venue. Now I don't have the QR code so cannot check in. What's wrong with QR link to a webpage? That works well. This app just adds failure.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 12:33:53__

> Poor. Three venues in a row where the QR code isn't recognised.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 04:04:22__

> Had my first chance to use it yesterday but the QR code would not scan (Oppo R9s). Does this app require internet connection when scanning the QR code? I had my data switched off and the app did not indicate it needed to be enabled.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 03:48:44__

> Scanning opens a link asking you to install the app - even if you have it. A couple more clicks to open the app and click 'Check In', and you'll need to go back to the front door and scan the QR code again from within the app. Unlike other quick and easy QR check ins, scanning the code from your camera will NOT simply open the app/site AND recognise the venue you're trying to check into. You have to realise the venue is using THIS app, open the app, then scan; OR scan, fiddle and scan again.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 01:29:22__

> Won't download - at Majura Park. Finished lunch - still trying to download ...<br> :date: __2020-09-21 04:58:28__
