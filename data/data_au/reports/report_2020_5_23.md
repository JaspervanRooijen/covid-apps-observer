## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Australian Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app) |
| **Email** | support@COVIDSafe.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH_ADMIN** | Normal | Allows applications to discover and pair bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting.

> No problems with installation, battery use or the app dropping off. All good. 2 updates so far.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 04:24:16__

> The app appears to do exactly what it says. I have had no issues since installing this app, but I only use my phone as a phone, not a media center like most people seem to. What little risk there might be to my privacy is vastly outweighed by the potential benefits.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 04:08:54__

> Looking forward to integration to Google Exposure API for more efficient battery use.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 13:11:36__

> I find it very difficult to negotiate the app.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 12:52:16__

> Didn't like the old version as I had lots of issues like causing the GMail app to stop syncing. Let alone the annoying permanent notification on the screen. But the new version overcome 90% of the issues. Well done Aussies!<br> :date: __2020-05-22 13:00:22__

> Generally don't notice the app running at all; however started using the phone for music in the car today and it constantly causes the cars Bluetooth to reset about 1-2 minutes into each song. Phone = Samsung S9+ Car = Mazda BT50 2014 (Don't know what version of Bluetooth) Hopefully you can resolve this issue.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 06:18:48__

> App works fine on my S9. Only issue is the battery drain.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 14:30:12__

> Great app, every Australian should get it! I'd give 5 stars but for 1 reason. I really don't like the permanent lock screen notification that the app is 'protecting' me. I don't care. I just want it to work quietly in the background and not bother me until it needs to. I'd be quite surprised if any user wants the app to remind them it is there every time they pick up their phone. Please create a setting to turn this off -- then you'll get my 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 10:36:51__

> Good but small things. hahahaha. Right. Got that<br> :date: __2020-05-21 09:00:54__

> Downloaded and uninstalled and downloaded again after having done more research. Easy to uninstall but need to switch off another in list of apps that appears as a code of letters and numerals which I presume is the encryption as stated in the privacy policy and conditions, worth reading in this case. No issues experienced in downloading and uninstalling on my Samsung S10! Also, no issues with my Bluetooth audio and car phone nor my audio ear buds and Bluetooth is turned off whilst home alone.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 03:38:46__

> Runs fine. Easy to set up. Unsure if Bluetooth drains battery quicker than normal but hey if it helps opening up the lockdown, so be it.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:20:47__

> Drains battery like crazy but it's for a good cause and it won't be forever so i can deal with it!<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:04:55__

> Mr Morrison said it only uses Bluetooth, it also uses your GPS. Also the notification bar is permanent.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 12:32:26__

> If the Govt were serious it should have been backwood compatible with earlier operating systems<br> :date: __2020-05-22 08:58:29__

> I've had no major problems. However the constant icon that appears with the install is annoying, I have a new Android so I was able to turn-off the foreground service notification for covidsafe in my app settings to get rid of it. I was unable to install the app to my elderly step dad's Samsung because despite only being a couple of years old it was incompatible. He reports that as a common issue amongst his peers. So I think there is room for improvement but no reason not to install it<br> :date: __2020-05-22 02:03:38__

> The concept is a good idea in theory. I only turn my wifi on when I leave home so I have not experienced any battery issues with my Galaxy S10 5G device. I don't believe any state or territory has been able to read any data being produced by this app yet, therefore it's difficult to know if the app is actually working?<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:42:39__

> Needs more Hing.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 09:03:39__

> Keeps turning off even though I have turned off battery optimisation settings.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 04:40:27__

> I know this is important so will keep it but it drains battery excessively. Almost to the point it's unusable. I've had to start carrying a portable charger when I'm out. I think I'm going to have to disable it when I'm at home. I can't carry a portable charger around the house. Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 16:40:19__

> When the app is installed and I'm connected to a device with Bluetooth and playing music, the music seems to cut out a lot. When the app is not installed it works fine.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 15:51:05__

> Can't fairly assess it yet. Seemed to work OK until I installed Malwarebytes to protect my device from malware attacks. Now the COVIDSafe icon is map of Australia keeps disappearing from top of my screen and is replaced by the Malwarebytes app symbol. If I go into the COVIDSafe app, it reappears and sits beside the Malware bytes icon at top of page a while and then disappears again. Is this OK? I thought the COVID icon had to remain there at all times. Why is the Covid icon disappearing?<br> :date: __2020-05-19 12:47:32__

> Have had to uninstall because of the excess battery drain, unable to carry out my day-to-day work and I rely on my device. Would love to be able to put this app to sleep when connected to my home WiFi - seems like a low hanging fruit to actually meet the problem this app is trying to solve.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 07:44:11__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

This app it had too many similarities to plague Inc, but the story was the biggest failure of it all.

AWS *does* have servers in Australia. It is very stable, and any sensitive data collected by the app (which afaik is *all* voluntary) will probably be about as secure as most government services.

However, the app has zero allowance for inquiry; no room to question the ongoing situation. I don't disregard the media as an institution but its reporter's are sometimes off the beaten path and want to break a story rather than provide valuable information.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
