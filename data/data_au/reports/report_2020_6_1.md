## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Australian Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app) |
| **Email** | support@COVIDSafe.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH_ADMIN** | Normal | Allows applications to discover and pair bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS** | Normal | Permission an application must hold in order to use Settings.ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS.

> Great idea, everyone should use this.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 12:00:28__

> It does what's expected. I have no loss of other Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run as before. It does not collect phone numbers, it collects Bluetooth id numbers, only if around for 15mins. Those id nmbrs can be seen using any free bluetooth scanner & tell you nothing. Only the remotely held database can link them to a phone number... if you download your id collection to the govt site... if you are diagnosed with CV-19. (BT sound cuts are from WIFI interaction & are common.)<br> :date: __2020-06-01 11:16:33__

> We'll have to wait and see the effectiveness of this app until there are some infected people and they do contact tracing using this. In the mean time, I start with a major issue; 1. The app is significantly disruptive to bluetooth audio streaming. Causing the audio to pause every few seconds. This was observed during a drive on the highway. It seems that the interruption is more frequent the faster you travel and by the number of phones in the vicinity. Phones in the vicinty can disrupt the audio playing from another phone's bluetooth. Switching off bluetooth in the nearby phones stopped the breaks in the audio streaming. I think this is a major issue especially since more and more people are using bluetooth headphones especially in public transport and the app will become useless if people get annoyed and uninstall it for this reason. 2. The app asks for locations permission when installing. Some people maybe be off put by this thinking that it is recording their location. However I think the location is used so that the app can conduct it's handshake when it knows you've moved location rather than it explicitly recording your location (happy to be corrected). 3. The app seems fairly unobtrusive after 4 weeks of use. Battery drain is not significantly higher (running a Note 9 with Android 10)<br> :date: __2020-05-28 03:20:07__

> Appears to be efficient.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 13:28:44__

> Gets used in the background once you set it up, which is very simple<br> :date: __2020-05-25 13:32:38__

> In the FAQ, it is mentioned that COVIDSafe collects only phone numbers of people with close proximity. Upon installing the app it requires permission to access location. I would recommend developers to turn off location and only collect the phone numbers, of people in close proximity. The reason why many Aussies don't install the app, people are concerned about privacy. Without much people using the app it won't be helpful.<br> :date: __2020-05-25 12:25:55__

> Seems to work. The notifaction thats always on is annoying. Least I can turn it off on s20. Needs an option to turn that off. Please keep the updates to github. Its good to go through the code to make sure its still above board<br> :date: __2020-05-25 02:19:42__

> Would have rated 5 stars if data contract went to AUS company rather than "make America great" USA. Have to keep installing and deleting as it interferes with my other blutooth connections- car, speakers, training monitor etc<br> :date: __2020-06-01 03:10:03__

> Buggy on older Android 6.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 00:31:17__

> Please make it compulsory to use on public transport, public places, cafes, shops, etc. E.g. currently, people are using one common pen when leaving their details in cafes, etc. Not safe. Should be touchless like this app.<br> :date: __2020-05-31 04:34:07__

> OK but not as good as Triple J<br> :date: __2020-05-30 10:34:29__

> I used this for a bit less than a month. If you have a new phone with large battery and other apps running Bluetooth frequently, and always have icons in your notification area all the time, this app will just be one more of those, and you probably won't mind it. For me who does not use my phone this way, i found it the number one contributor to battery drain and literally the only notification that literally does not go away, regardless of whether you have the app active (bluetooth on).<br> :date: __2020-05-29 02:46:40__

> I've had the app on my Oppo for quite a while now. No matter how many times I set the permissions to disable battery optimisation, it never, ever sticks. Every time I look at my phone, it says I've chosen for that app in particular to use up as much juice as it likes. But the app says it's not active and I need to check my permissions again. The last advice I found online, was to uninstall the app, update my OS and reinstall. But when I did that I found I already have the latest update!<br> :date: __2020-05-28 13:43:57__

> It keeps interfering with any additional bluetooth device that I connect to when running this app. For example, if I connect to a bluetooth speaker or to my car for hands-free and maps, it drops me out every 15min or so, losing connection and having to re-start everything manually again. It will suddenly cut out any calls, music or maps directions. Would be great if this was fixed so we can keep running it in the background without interruptions.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 00:59:35__

> I really want to support this as I believe in a community response to coronavirus, but this isn't it. There are known issues with iOS, so it's unlikely that I'm getting contact info from any iPhones. I've always had Bluetooth enabled (watch, car audio) but this app doesn't play with other devices, continuously dropping audio being the easiest example.<br> :date: __2020-05-31 15:50:06__

> Causes major connectivity issues with my Bluetooth devices, constantly makes my head phones and fitbit conect and reconnect at some points getting so bad (even when no one else is around) that i had to turn off the app. Also not a fan of the notification doesnt really need to be there constantly to do it job the app is doing that.<br> :date: __2020-05-31 10:28:25__

> Too resource demanding from my phone. Battery drains much quicker and bluetooth connections stutter constantly. Please download it because better safe than sorry.<br> :date: __2020-05-30 19:13:39__

> I do understand the importance and would still encourage all to download for the sake of society's safety BUT honestly, its slightly annoyingly as it does interfere with all additional Bluetooth devices (headphones, speakers) with audio pausing and distorting for 5 or so seconds every 30-60 seconds, extremely frustrating!<br> :date: __2020-05-30 07:14:39__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Migration+Council+Australia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Migration+Council+Australia) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
