### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, letâ€™s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the BluetoothÂ® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact youâ€™ve had with other users by securely logging the other userâ€™s reference code. If you or someone youâ€™ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and usedâ€”with your consentâ€”by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people whoâ€™ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>â€¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>â€¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>â€¢ Turn on BluetoothÂ®
<br>â€¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>â€¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If youâ€™ve been exposed to the virus by someone youâ€™ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Would be irresponsible to not have this app. It will help Australia prevent large outbreaks and allow us to live more normally. The reviews about Bluetooth dropping out seem to not be generally true. I use Airpods via Bluetooth with my Samsung S8 and it all works fine.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 06:21:34__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-06-13 05:37:57__

> After a few updates it finally became the app that just runs in the background without impacting other apps, Bluetooth, etc. Its just there in the background and i don't even remember i have it installed<br> :date: __2020-06-12 03:16:33__

> Ido use this app regularly to check how things are going.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 19:27:20__

> Tip: as the app conflicts with my Bluetooth headphones. You can go to settings > apps > force stop. As needed. An official fix would be nice ðŸ˜Š<br> :date: __2020-06-14 07:10:17__

> Workwell I haven't met anyone with the virus<br> :date: __2020-06-12 12:48:54__

> Good to see the latest update to include older android versions seems to be working my bluetooth headset stops playing for a second when someone's close<br> :date: __2020-06-10 19:39:16__

> This app is really smashing my battery life!<br> :date: __2020-06-09 11:14:01__

> Easy to use, simple<br> :date: __2020-06-09 02:46:49__

> The app crashes on launch for me now. EDIT: I fixed this by clearing the apps data from storage, but that of course means that all contacts I've logged over the past few weeks have been lost.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 13:35:39__

> Please remove it from the notification tray it is annoying, the small symbol above like wifi bluetooth ect is fine. Happy to help fellow Aussies. 5 stars if that is fixed.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 04:40:44__

> Mmm<br> :date: __2020-06-08 02:57:17__

> Bluetooth dropouts... Disappointing but I guess it serves its purpose..<br> :date: __2020-06-14 11:03:05__

> Apps a good idea, I'm relying on this apps to keep my family and myself safe but it keeps on turning itself off.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 12:46:39__

> This app should not need location data and should run in the background without pop ups<br> :date: __2020-06-12 07:00:18__

> Does seem to also work on android 5.0.1 Install is a bit funny as it hung on permissions page but still installed. Couple restarts but basically mostly stable and running.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 09:00:31__

> It works out for all<br> :date: __2020-06-10 12:23:24__

> The app serves its purpose however given the link to Bluetooth is it creating no end of Bluetooth connectivity issues resulting in the dropping put of other bluetooth connected devices (headphones, Android auto, etc)<br> :date: __2020-06-10 01:13:23__

> It causes repeated drop out of my Bluetooth devices (headphones, smart watch etc.). I have also found the latest update is causing a significant increase in battery drainage which is incredibly annoying.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 14:58:20__

> Still not 100% sure it is the app or just a huge coincidence. Ever since I have installed the app, my Bluetooth in the car gets momentarily disconnected. While it does reconnect, it is a real issue as it invariably happens during a call. If it keeps happening, I will uninstall and see if things improve.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 11:17:09__

> Keeps on bugging my BT connections as I use a BT headphone<br> :date: __2020-06-08 02:19:43__

> Needs to be more compatible with older device. Drains the battery, my phone is about 3+ years old. Keep bluetooth off and disable app permissions unless i leave the house. Easy to install.<br> :date: __2020-06-07 21:41:19__

> It was ok at first, but i noticed lots of connectivity issues and CovidSafe was the last app installed, after uninstalling the app, connection issues appear to be resolved.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 08:21:30__

> Keeps asking for battery optimisation permission everytime<br> :date: __2020-06-13 06:16:13__

> Nice idea but uninstalled as it causes connectivity issues with other devices, most importantly hands free in the car. Also causes much higher battery drain.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 02:02:31__

> Bluetooth issues. Ever since installing I've had BT issues with other devices not being able to reconnect, without clearing cache and data, then all other devices reconnect for a few days, then problems start again.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 01:59:59__

> Great initiative but destroys your Bluetooth audio. Constant skips and pauses with a variety of speakers that all work fine without this app installed.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 12:39:29__

> Over the last 2 weeks the app keeps crashing several times a day. This will stop it doing it's job if you come into contact with a known case when the app isn't functioning. The only way i can see it has crashed is by looking at the screen. No sound happens when it crashes.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 01:56:00__

> Yes it installs on 5.1 now but gets stuck after enabling Bluetooth. Proceed does not enable battery optimisation off and Bluetooth location. Oppo R7+ with ColorOs.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 00:18:12__

> Constant issues with Bluetooth dropping out when playing music<br> :date: __2020-06-11 05:14:42__

> Lots of Bluetooth connectivity issues. Not connecting or long time to connect. Smart watch will not connect at all. Bit frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-06-10 22:49:44__

> I really want to use this app as it is a great idea. However since installing it, I've had nothing but issues with my phone, issues with updating important apps for work, even battery life is messed up. App can't work without an alive phone, and phone can't stay alive if said app drains it of all power before it has a chance to do anyone any good. So it's a no for me regarding the installation of this app. I stick to what we have been doing since this all started. Keep distance and wash hands.<br> :date: __2020-06-10 15:04:54__

> Gives no information about status<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:02:03__

> My screen locks and goes blank any time I revive or make call. Have to uninstalled, friend has same issue. Tried re installing, issue is back.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 06:32:55__

> I had to uninstall do to issues with black screen during phone calls Sony Xperia XA2. I couldn't use the keypad, speaker or even end calls. No problem since uninstalling.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 05:57:20__

> I installed it couple weeks ago and checked it few times since then. It is never active. Always requires something else although i allowed all app permissions.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 03:34:57__

> Too easy to accidentally disable or remove when in use or it crashes (either way you think it's working but it's not) also had to uninstall and reinstall because "push notifications" refused to activate. Would be nice too to be told someone near you has the app up and running otherwise what's the point? btw had no problems prior to last update!<br> :date: __2020-06-14 02:56:15__

> It's stopped working. Crashes every time I relaunch it. This is in the last couple of days. Please fix it!<br> :date: __2020-06-14 01:21:12__

> Installed this app when it was first released but it's caused so many issues on my phone, blocking Bluetooth, whatsapp messages and app downloads. I've tried it three times now and each time have had to uninstall after a few days as the reduced phone function is too impractical. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 15:51:50__

> This worked well before you "fixed" it. Now it continues to crash.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 12:42:58__

> Ever since downloading the app my phone battery dies within a few hours. The same happens to my parents phones. I'm now deleting the app. Useless.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 12:11:20__

> Any app that forces a notification on my notification bar all the time is disabled at best, uninstalled usually. Get rid of that dumb feature<br> :date: __2020-06-13 11:30:29__
