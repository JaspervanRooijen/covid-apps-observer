### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Is it possible to remove the status card on the app? It's super annoying that I can't get rid of it. Still giving you 5 stars for creating an app for this purpose but the card is annoying. Also, why doesn't the app not track location? Bluetooth doesn't seem to be good enough.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 06:32:27__

> Hi,.thanks for the app, please ignore the idiots. Just wondering if it will be updated to access the Google exposure notification system? Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-08-15 08:54:21__

> Keep safeüêà<br> :date: __2020-08-14 11:11:26__

> I downloaded the CovidSafe application to Nokia 9 OS: Pie. There seems to be no initial problems with the program. However, there is no Exposure Notification badge. It reacts to the deactivation of Bluetooth, via silent notification. Reminder: To activate when you leave home or visit a public place. There is no threat to device security, the app has limited access. Our hyena or wessel-trait individual's wouldn't declare themselves sick, unless hospitalised.

> For the government<br> :date: __2020-08-13 10:44:41__

> Thank you Australia for this great initiative. (Edited) Previous bug I experienced seems to be fixed in the latest version.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 14:34:35__

> I can't see a reason why people avoid using this app. Yes is using battery but if it helps following virus is too small price to pay. We are in this together.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 10:28:49__

> When it works that is.. üòÅ<br> :date: __2020-08-17 04:46:39__

> I'm not closing the app but I keep finding it had closed itself.<br> :date: __2020-08-16 04:06:25__

> A useful app that causes slightly more battery usage but anything that helps to contact trace people potentially affected by the Chinese Communist Party Virus (CCP Virus), is worth having as an additional tool to help fight this Chinese biological weapon. If any good that came from this CCP Virus is that it revealed China's true colours & is helping the rest of the world in unititing in worldwide retribution against the CCP. Hopefully this brings a demise to this brutal and authoritarian regime.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 07:06:18__

> Had to delete cache & data & reregister after update, otherwise it crashes constantly<br> :date: __2020-08-10 06:54:42__

> This CovidSafe tokenisation should be integrated with businesses that need to keep customers information , a quick QR scan and verification message/ sound that the location /business is recorded. Instead of having to (mis)enter your details each time manually/handwritten or mistakenly deliberately because people don't want to leave their details everywhere<br> :date: __2020-08-10 02:30:53__

> No problems with the app at all here. It's just disappointing that the app hasn't been as useful as it promised to be.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 09:24:51__

> Working ok so far..<br> :date: __2020-08-09 04:59:44__

> 9/8 - Kept crashing after July 30 update, had to re-install several times before registration would work again. 10/7 - Kept crashing after July Android patches, had to re-install it and is fine now.<br> :date: __2020-08-08 17:48:03__

> Please review the 15-minute threshold for logging - I'd want to know if a positive case was near me for 1 minute. It currently feels like false security for the sacrifice of battery and bluetooth audio continuity.<br> :date: __2020-08-08 14:31:34__

> Can i download the covidsafe app on a tablet<br> :date: __2020-08-15 08:03:45__

> Working from home in Sydney and go out less than once a week. I can't see any way to turn it off when not needed. Can't get IFTTT to turn off when in WiFi zone.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 23:05:52__

> It keeps dropping of.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 11:56:57__

> Has been working on Android 6.0.1 until the last few days, when it now requires Battery optimisation to be disabled. I have tried all help instruction and any other possible way to switch off battery optimisation but the COVIDSafe app (v 1.0.48) still will not work. Hope they fix the problem soon.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 07:01:21__

> I know programmers are trying their best but app shows it can't access location. Between blutooth, wifi and nfc can assemble good location lock anyway.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:16:16__

> Was working fine until latest update, accepted the location settings, but now makes my phone (Pixel 2) crash and restart every time I open Google Maps. Had to uninstall so I could use my phone!<br> :date: __2020-08-11 00:37:39__

> Very supportive of the concept. But, after the update, there's an Android notification saying it is not active because it needs location permissions. It does have location permissions. The app itself says it's active. So I have no idea if it's working or not<br> :date: __2020-08-10 23:11:48__

> Why one would change a perfectly good notification icon that made it easy to see whether the app was working or not into an icon with a misleading tick, accompanied by a message saying the app is not working, is beyond my understanding.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 16:43:41__

> Latest update a problem. I use on Android. I do not have location on generally on my phone, but have given this app specifically location permission. Before the update, all fine. This update only allows the app to work if I turn on location for all my apps. I don't want to do that.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 06:04:32__

> ( edited for later versions) Easy install. Read the help for why it wants but don't need Location turned on ( not sure anymore, but later versions may need GPS on. Getting mixed starus indicators from the apps different icons) . Also it explicitly states that Government and law enforcement can not use it to check social distancing or meetings.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 22:41:03__

> After latest update unable to use my Bluetooth headphones due to constant cut-outs. Stopping the app fixes that issue.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 10:13:10__

> As of today (13/8) I get alerts that the app isn't active. When I open the app, it decides it's active. When I go into settings, I ensure that it can access location at all times. But I still keep getting this alert. It stops being active when I lock the phone.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 08:20:29__

> Recent update requires location services to be on all the time. This is a deal breaker for me. I will leave it running and hope it continues to work without it (it has permission to access location so all Bluetooth functions work)<br> :date: __2020-08-12 02:49:55__

> I can understand the need for this app, but at the the moment; the cons outweigh the pros. On paper, using our devices to help pinpoint potential hotspots sounds like a good idea. But due to the fact that the app not only needs to always run in the background (even in power saving), it's constant access to location turning a 4day battery into 6 hours and consistent interruption of Bluetooth devices make this more of a hastle, rather then a utility. Please fix the Bluetooth and battery issues<br> :date: __2020-08-12 02:39:32__

> They said it does not require location services. After recent update, does not work without location services "on". Very supportive of the government and the purpose of the app, but I don't allow any app to use my location services unless it is necessary for the use of the app. Your location is not required for the purpose of the app, especially when the government said that it does use your location.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 01:01:06__

> Disconnects other bluetooth devices such as headphones while app is running<br> :date: __2020-08-11 11:38:14__

> Causes audio stuttering on galaxy a51 and toyota corolla<br> :date: __2020-08-11 08:21:58__

> Want to use this app but causes my screen to go black on phone calls sometimes. We have to reboot. It does the same thing to my wife's. We both run Android 9 on Sony Phones. Mine is an XA2 Ultra hers an XA2 Plus. Both pretty new phones we otherwise have zero problems with.<br> :date: __2020-08-11 07:19:36__

> Please explain why it is now asking for location with the latest update?<br> :date: __2020-08-11 04:18:15__

> Was working well but did drain my battery. However 3 days ago I am getting notifications that it is not active, however when you open the app it is active.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 23:52:54__
