### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, letâ€™s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the BluetoothÂ® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact youâ€™ve had with other users by securely logging the other userâ€™s reference code. If you or someone youâ€™ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and usedâ€”with your consentâ€”by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people whoâ€™ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>â€¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>â€¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>â€¢ Turn on BluetoothÂ®
<br>â€¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>â€¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If youâ€™ve been exposed to the virus by someone youâ€™ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I7uui 8th is 4hi<br> :date: __2020-10-09 04:23:06__

> It does what's expected. I have no loss of Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run ok. It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space. Wld prfr coloured dot on the icon.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 02:28:46__

> Had no issues with this app EXCEPT that only 25% of the population uses it so what is the point. Probably should have been pushed out to all active mobiles by the Govt, like bushfire warning and the like. Have now uninstalled it as do not come into contact with many people these days and my location has no active cases.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:28:13__

> This app has no effect on any aspect of your life unless you come into contact with someone else who has the app AND also has a positive test for COVID. all the scare-mongering about it comes from morons.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 13:06:27__

> Essential to help contains the virus<br> :date: __2020-10-01 00:01:22__

> Its doing its job as intended, wirh only minor rare bluetooth dropouts.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 02:44:33__

> Happy to do my bit to help out with covid management. Having said that my battery usage has gone through the roof since last update. COVIDSafe is at the top of my battery use list by a country mile. Hopefully the update I have done this morning will fix.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 00:03:57__

> Initially worked ok but hasn't worked for a few months now. Back working again.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 08:06:08__

> Why is this app always on without having to turn LOCATIONS some phones and not others? Both our phones are same make and mine is newer model, yet I have to manually turn Location on even though I gave given it permission to be on all the time. Why is this?<br> :date: __2020-09-25 12:06:26__

> On screen icon keeps disappering. Keep needing to open app to keep it active<br> :date: __2020-09-23 11:23:51__

> Happy to use but better if app turns on automatically when Bluetooth and GPS is on, shows active case numbers, doesn't require GPS (drains battery).<br> :date: __2020-09-20 03:50:59__

> Is this even worthwhile anymore?<br> :date: __2020-09-16 14:41:22__

> No phone or battery issues on my samsung a5. Would like to see time shortened from 15 minutes to 1 or 2 minutes and warn me when I'm close to someone would be much better so I can move away. Otherwise it's fine. Can't see the point of having it if it waits 15 minutes to say I've been close to someone that's not good.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 00:47:04__

> Recent updates are draining the battery. It consumes more than YouTube every day, even watching a few videos. Fix it or people will end up uninstalling. And do we need to be 15mins with someone infected to get infected? Should be reduced to 3 or 5 mins. Otherwise useless.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 11:30:26__

> Not able to update phone number. Only way is to uninstall and reinstall, which means the previous data is now unreachable. If I had contact with a positive case last week on the old number, I would not be reachable.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 07:27:49__

> Can't sign up... Says try again later...<br> :date: __2020-10-08 16:28:47__

> Why does the Covid app now require my gps to be activated as well as bluetooth. I was a supporter of the app, yet now it stays 'inactive'.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 14:31:18__

> Crashes when I try to open.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 05:33:27__

> Frequently find the app has shut itself down significantly reducing any benefit it's use may offer in my situation.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 04:42:46__

> Was running fine for months then, I'm thinking at last update, it kept turning my Location on and draining my battery. I looked into the app and it is not active due to Location turned off. Before I only had to have "Location Permission" turned on for this app... Not the overall location. Not going to turn the Loaction on. I will just leave it inactive. These systems won't work if they're not usable.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 13:13:25__

> Anything to combat Covid-19. However has a high battery drainage: 30 to 40% of total consumption of device.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 07:26:03__

> There should be an option to exit this app, when at home. It consumes battery unnecessarily, when the Bluetooth and location is turned off. You should understand there are people out there who do not enable location and Bluetooth unnecessarily, when not in use. I have to stop this app everytime when at home.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 06:48:17__

> Well its ok and all its just 2 major problems. 1 absolutely battery drainer 2 absloute data drainer<br> :date: __2020-09-30 06:23:11__
