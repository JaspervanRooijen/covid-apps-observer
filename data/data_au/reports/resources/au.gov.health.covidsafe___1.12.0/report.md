### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It does what's expected. I have no loss of Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run ok. It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space. Wld prfr coloured dot on the icon.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 02:28:46__

> Had no issues with this app EXCEPT that only 25% of the population uses it so what is the point. Probably should have been pushed out to all active mobiles by the Govt, like bushfire warning and the like. Have now uninstalled it as do not come into contact with many people these days and my location has no active cases.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:28:13__

> This app has no effect on any aspect of your life unless you come into contact with someone else who has the app AND also has a positive test for COVID. all the scare-mongering about it comes from morons.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 13:06:27__

> It's a good idea. However I know several young people who believe that the app could be used to track whether they are breaking COVID restrictions so they won't download. Govt should guarantee noone will be prosecuted based on info from the app. Would increase use.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:05:21__

> Chews power :(<br> :date: __2020-10-16 09:42:48__

> No idea what the app actually does. Seems useless so uninstalled. Perhaps if there was information or statistics about successful contact tracing using data collected from the app I would keep it updated.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 00:26:30__

> Not sure that it's working though.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 00:23:58__

> I dislike that it's constantly showing a notification and am concerned that it drains my battery. Are enough people using this app to justify having it installed on my phone? How many people have been contacted as a result of using it?<br> :date: __2020-10-12 11:33:56__

> 5.5mm 600mm has 8o9l8y<br> :date: __2020-10-16 07:24:23__

> Be nice if it worked. Despite having the battery optimisation turned off for this app, it keeps coming up "inactive" and telling me to change the setting. I agree and it says active. A few minutes later I get a notification that it's inactive again.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 04:41:05__

> Doesn't tell me if there are cases nearby, which would be the most important thing it could do. Who cares about the number of cases , I can get that info on the news.<br> :date: __2020-10-12 14:11:12__

> Recent updates are draining the battery. It consumes more than YouTube every day, even watching a few videos. Fix it or people will end up uninstalling. And do we need to be 15mins with someone infected to get infected? Should be reduced to 3 or 5 mins. Otherwise useless.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 11:30:26__

> Not able to update phone number. Only way is to uninstall and reinstall, which means the previous data is now unreachable. If I had contact with a positive case last week on the old number, I would not be reachable.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 07:27:49__

> Can't sign up... Says try again later...<br> :date: __2020-10-08 16:28:47__

> Why does the Covid app now require my gps to be activated as well as bluetooth. I was a supporter of the app, yet now it stays 'inactive'.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 14:31:18__

> Crashes when I try to open.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 05:33:27__

> Frequently find the app has shut itself down significantly reducing any benefit it's use may offer in my situation.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 04:42:46__

> Bug -User cant registet with phone number. Note:Phone number from any country regions.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 06:54:37__

> I'm a supporter of the concept but have serious doubts about the utility of this implementation. I've not heard of any positive track and trace outcomes in months. At the same time the current version now drains my battery at about twice the rate of all my other apps combined. The government now has a short time to show cause why this app should be retained, otherwise I plan to uninstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 03:49:36__

> A total power hog. Uses more power than any other app, and I don't know why.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 14:45:48__

> Bro it didnt even work. The free indi game made by two men in a 3rd world country could function better than this. Like really?<br> :date: __2020-10-15 12:59:39__

> I have had bluetooth connection issues since installing this app, which I can deal with, but over the past couple of months it has started using ridiculous amounts of battery (like 80% of battery used up in 4 hours!) - the app isn't much use if it is going to kill my phone before I can get home.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 10:41:56__
