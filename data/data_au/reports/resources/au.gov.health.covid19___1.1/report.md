## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm thinking big box around the end of my bed = vr. Has potential if anything. He won't. / Rub my forehead LatcH<br> :date: __2020-06-16 09:18:45__

> Would be great if you could also put how many active cases there are.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:11:52__

> Works as expected, an information manager, not a source (otherwise the app would need updating daily). Helps to get at relevant, reliable information, without needing to hunt around the web myself to find it.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 10:32:15__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-05-11 11:25:39__

> Cant self register<br> :date: __2020-04-30 02:43:21__

> Being a high risk person I installed the app, put in details. I was told to see my gp which I did and even had the test. The app doesn't allow you to report that you have done it and for you to say that you don't have COVID19 . I think that would be something that should have been added.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 04:01:07__

> Just updated<br> :date: __2020-04-28 10:47:52__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Keeps turning itself off!<br> :date: __2020-05-19 04:42:12__

> It hasn't updated. Supposed to update at 9:00 AM daily.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 01:15:17__

> Never have received the pin to open it<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:20:55__

> Won't download past 97%<br> :date: __2020-05-07 12:21:06__

> Mostly disappointed that in all government media announcements they just say 'download the app' without specifying the name of the app clearly. There are several COVID-19 apps out there now. Give it a distinctive name.<br> :date: __2020-05-07 10:02:42__

> An interactive app would be far more useful. INPUT Activity I want to undertake? Personal details? Employment details? Reason for activity? PROCESS Verification process. OUTPUT. Approval /Denial /More information - contact Barcode issued to applicant on approval. Applicant issued with a description of any special requirements. Eg: FIFO to travel Site - WA - NSW - WA - site Can the process be undertaken? ANS Special requirements (isolation and period and process for each state)<br> :date: __2020-05-05 12:10:07__

> Laggy on the opening and update of information but enough for quick access check .<br> :date: __2020-05-05 09:48:51__

> Dear Gov Oz good overall but if time ask those negative reviews e.g. force closure what system they use....keep up good work... we pray to Jesu Mary's Health bless us<br> :date: __2020-05-04 13:56:47__

> Lite info and few updates ... than news media<br> :date: __2020-05-01 10:01:51__

> I'm sure it's a great app but there is constantly a reminder in my notifications that I can't get rid of. Very very frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-05-28 18:16:57__

> Not enough real time information I would like to see more statistics especially our Reff number<br> :date: __2020-05-07 11:17:36__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

> Confusing<br> :date: __2020-05-04 09:43:14__

> Will not download on my phone<br> :date: __2020-05-01 08:18:24__

> Takes forever to download. Been trying for 2 days now.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 10:31:12__

> I downloaded it but still do not know if it is actually working.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 03:53:37__

> Please add a prominent link to the covidsafe app.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:50:53__

> Update too late every day<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:17:59__

> Buggy as!<br> :date: __2020-04-26 13:48:12__
