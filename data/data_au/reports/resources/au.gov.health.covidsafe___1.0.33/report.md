### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, letâ€™s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the BluetoothÂ® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact youâ€™ve had with other users by securely logging the other userâ€™s reference code. If you or someone youâ€™ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and usedâ€”with your consentâ€”by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people whoâ€™ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>â€¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>â€¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>â€¢ Turn on BluetoothÂ®
<br>â€¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>â€¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If youâ€™ve been exposed to the virus by someone youâ€™ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> No issues with blutooth. I suggest people who are struggling with that in the car, turn the radio ABC news on instead of spotify, to keep up with yhe news? Then your phone is free for calls. And get an extra charger for work and car, to deal with the battery drain. These are tough times. Now IS the time to deviate from our comfort zone.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 10:25:05__

> Works as described but last update has messed up my notifications incredibly and i am not only one experiencing this<br> :date: __2020-07-19 12:04:17__

> Hey guys, there must be something wrong with the app in the background, my phone keeps deactivating the app and I have a warning that it's not active, but when I go in the app it says everything is working fine. Then 5 mins later (more or less) it's goes offline again. Then the phone is happy. Then again later on it's all turned off. I got no idea what is going on here<br> :date: __2020-07-18 05:35:12__

> Bit of a power drainer, when at home, switch off Bluetooth and location, icons and settings. But like buying masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, we can all help to beat Coronavirus.<br> :date: __2020-07-16 02:57:34__

> Kept crashing after July Android patches, had to re-install it and is fine now<br> :date: __2020-07-15 10:25:28__

> Works fine on my phone. For security, I turn Bluetooth off, and deny location permissions, as soon as I return home. Also, i suggest to give it a fake name instead of your full name when you register.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:44:42__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-07-13 02:40:25__

> App was turning off. Ive deleted it and reinstalled. Appears to be working ok now and doesnt drain battery on android phone.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 07:54:16__

> Put the app on the phone like they said have not had a problem with it Blue tooth OK.<br> :date: __2020-07-08 14:40:30__

> Seems to work better on Chinese made devices. Probably because that's were the virus was manufactured. It's doing its job as I have been protected from the virus so far. I wish they made a diarorah app that would also prevent me from getting that as well. So far this app as also been invisibly zapping away the cold virus and other germs. If anyone looks sick it's best to point your phone at them with the app on. This will sterilise them to give you enough time to escape without getting COVID<br> :date: __2020-07-20 15:10:53__

> Why not have a sign in button when people got to Venues such as restruants as a digital sign. And have the the Maitre D or someone from the venue witness the customer signing in. That way it won't breach the Privacy ACT as opposed to the current system implemented<br> :date: __2020-07-19 09:38:04__

> I too had the app constantly switch off. SOLUTION: i believe the following two things can help this solution (seems to have helped me through the last day): 1. Settings - Location -... - Scanning - disable Bluetooth Scanning. I believe this interrupts the covidsafe app. 2. Settings - Developer Options (google this to find out how to enable) - enable Bluetooth HCI Snoop Log. Having reported issue and possible solution through the app, why I haven't heard back from Covidsafe app team.<br> :date: __2020-07-18 07:06:19__

> Okay but still unsure if its detecting "live" contacts. I see about 20 strangers a day in downtown Sourhport. How do we know if it's really doing the job?<br> :date: __2020-07-18 05:21:43__

> Causes bluetooth problems. I am quite happy to do my bit to track and stay safe but the bluetooth problems are frustrating<br> :date: __2020-07-15 09:30:49__

> Seems to work but has messed up my lock screen notifications. Please fix.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 08:46:58__

> After the latest update, the notifications on my Moto G6 Plus (running Android 9.0) have been partially obscured and a solid line can be seen across the top of the screen in screensaver mode.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 07:07:58__

> The app is a battery drainer, there's no two ways about it. I use an automation app to disable bluetooth when I'm at home and re-enable when I leave home. That's made a world of difference to my battery life.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 04:52:16__

> Stops other bluetooth apps from working. Motorola g7+ android 10. The app stops Fitbit app from connecting properly. Also will not allow connection with car audio hands-free VW Golf.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 13:54:51__

> Keeps disabled itself due to inability to cope with battery-saving.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 08:05:44__
