### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It does what's expected. I have no loss of Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run ok. It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space. Wld prfr coloured dot on the icon.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 02:28:46__

> Had no issues with this app EXCEPT that only 25% of the population uses it so what is the point. Probably should have been pushed out to all active mobiles by the Govt, like bushfire warning and the like. Have now uninstalled it as do not come into contact with many people these days and my location has no active cases.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:28:13__

> I really like the idea of this app if it actually worked... But it doesn't. It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 02:07:56__

> I don't get codes will I need two get scanning or anything else if you'll be pretty please do something about this I will be gripple<br> :date: __2020-10-26 06:36:18__

> I'd been using this OK for months and (probably after an update) I discovered it was asking for location access and no battery optimisation. Having allowed those, it started draining the battery - 27% one day. I removed it, rebooted the phone and reinstalled the app. So far so good today. About 5th in the list of battery users at 1.8%.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 06:28:19__

> Really needs to be improved to support Apple-Google ENS. I don't like now there's issues between device communication, adding this would be very beneficial for the app and all of Australia<br> :date: __2020-10-22 08:58:55__

> Power saving mode is being turned on all the time in spite of being turned off<br> :date: __2020-10-20 22:04:54__

> Have to stay to close for to long! üòµ<br> :date: __2020-10-19 22:17:42__

> Be nice to have a simple way to close the app when you're home.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 00:57:45__

> It's a good idea. However I know several young people who believe that the app could be used to track whether they are breaking COVID restrictions so they won't download. Govt should guarantee noone will be prosecuted based on info from the app. Would increase use.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:05:21__

> Chews power :(<br> :date: __2020-10-16 09:42:48__

> No idea what the app actually does. Seems useless so uninstalled. Perhaps if there was information or statistics about successful contact tracing using data collected from the app I would keep it updated.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 00:26:30__

> Says it needs internet. Notification always on. Annoying.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 12:10:10__

> On s20 ultra need to restart the app if your phone battery died on you by overuse as it doesn't start automatically when you run out of juice mostly when I'm streaming videos. Took a star off due to the generic email response from customer service<br> :date: __2020-10-26 07:35:10__

> Keeps turning off.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 01:00:16__

> When first released this app didn't have any issues that concerned me. A subsequent update has resulted in it causing significant battery drain though, with the app now the largest consumer of my phone's battery, using more battery each day than an hour+ of Web browsing.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 00:12:30__

> I do like the idea of this app but as always the implementation isn't great. This app kept interfering with Bluetooth connections: my smart watch and car would constantly drop out and need a manual reconnect. No problems since uninstalling it. I'm in Queensland so it's less of an issue!<br> :date: __2020-10-19 22:13:04__

> Irresponsible that qr code check-in has not been implemented. Australians are losing their private data to third parties. The government needs to step up, and protect the privacy of Australians, and provide a safer means to qr code check-in.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 03:25:32__

> Drained my battery today. Please investigate possible bug. Update: Drained again...uninstalling now. I need more than half a day of battery...<br> :date: __2020-10-30 06:48:38__

> App no longer works if location is off and the App website states that Google require this for Bluetooth to work. This contradicts the fact that my other apps use Bluetooth fine w/o location on. Contact tracing does not need to know where I was, just who I contacted. And Google certainly does not need to know where I was. Will be leaving disabled.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 22:27:53__

Alone for hosting they claim $800k is required. The app is supposedly storing the data on the device not in the cloud, why would cloud hosting cost that much then? Think yourself...
