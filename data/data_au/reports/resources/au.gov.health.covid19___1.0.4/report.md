In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Coronavirus is the information of the most dangerous sickness in the world. The first time in the world that we have to work together and help each other for this reason we should all stay-at-home and try not to have a visitor and if we could get together and must fallow all the important information about this virus.COVID19. We will need to cooperate for the best way to back our normal life, I will have to be careful with my own experience with this. I am very happy and excited when the latest<br> :date: __2020-05-11 18:17:42__

> It's very useful and gives me peace of mind<br> :date: __2020-05-08 20:19:48__

> Crucial app you need to survive this disease that was definitely not released by any government or grouping of people to quell the overwhelming amount of people that are alive. This app it had too many similarities to plague Inc, but the story was the biggest failure of it all. I mean truly, who would believe our governments would release this disease on the people, it's too cruel to imagine. It's not like the powers to be around you are plotting against you. Or are they..<br> :date: __2020-05-08 02:07:04__

> I am reviewing in response to the current most highly rated negative review. TLDR this is not spyware. Storing data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) is no real concern. AWS *does* have servers in Australia. It is very stable, and any sensitive data collected by the app (which afaik is *all* voluntary) will probably be about as secure as most government services. Using AWS means 99.99% uptime (not exaggerating), that the app is available much sooner than it would be otherwise, and cheaper on tax $$<br> :date: __2020-05-06 10:36:30__

> A must have app. Works seamlessly in the background and makes me feel more confident that I will know if I've been exposed to the virus. Everyone should have it<br> :date: __2020-05-05 22:22:45__

> Would be great if you could also put how many active cases there are.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:11:52__

> Works as expected, an information manager, not a source (otherwise the app would need updating daily). Helps to get at relevant, reliable information, without needing to hunt around the web myself to find it.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 10:32:15__

> Being a high risk person I installed the app, put in details. I was told to see my gp which I did and even had the test. The app doesn't allow you to report that you have done it and for you to say that you don't have COVID19 . I think that would be something that should have been added.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 04:01:07__

> Lite info and few updates ... than news media<br> :date: __2020-05-01 10:01:51__

> Okay, this app keeps consumers informed and offers a dialect about what to do if you need to do something/anything. However, the app has zero allowance for inquiry; no room to question the ongoing situation. I don't disregard the media as an institution but its reporter's are sometimes off the beaten path and want to break a story rather than provide valuable information. Things will get better, stay vigilant and patient.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 14:26:47__

> Not enough real time information I would like to see more statistics especially our Reff number<br> :date: __2020-05-07 11:17:36__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__
