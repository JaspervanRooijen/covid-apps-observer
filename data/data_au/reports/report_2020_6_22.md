## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Australian Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app) |
| **Email** | support@COVIDSafe.gov.au |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Australian+Department+of+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Australian+Department+of+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH_ADMIN** | Normal | Allows applications to discover and pair bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting.

> Worthy aim and a way we can all help. Version 1.0 28 is even more stable for me. 1.0.21 stays alive long enough to be useful. Still stops working after several hours and rebooting is needed to get going again. Version 6.0.1 of Android. Err message flashes with description "Unfortunately, Bluetooth Share has stopped". In this state I couldn't even answer a call. Very little usefulness for my Motorola Moto G 3rd generation. Tried with versions 1.0.1, 1.0.16, 1.0.17 with no success. Still hopeful.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 12:47:13__

> A good use of technology to help reduce the spread of this disease. Leaving bluetooth on sure drains the battery though. This latest version solved the previous problem of unexpectedly closing.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 12:02:36__

> Seems to work fine. Hope never to find out....<br> :date: __2020-06-21 11:53:01__

> Doesn't drain battery, faster than usual anyway have not noticed it causing any additional issues that I can attribute to this app. Stays on all the time. Have never had to restart.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 01:26:33__

> Brilliant!! Thank you 😁<br> :date: __2020-06-20 15:29:37__

> Zero issues. Works as intended. Some initial issues with Bluetooth streaming audio but these are easily overcome with updates and firmware updates on speakers.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 12:55:42__

> I'll give 5 stars when @VictorianCHO's (and/or other states') contact tracers release evidence clearly demonstrating that it is an effective, and cost effective, adjunct to manual contact tracing, and thus can a) help put asymptomatic carriers into quarantine, and b) extinguish hot spots more quickly. Their hype, my hope. Happy since v1.0.16 that it no longer nags to switch on GPS. v1.0.11 did. On this Samsung S5 the Bluetooth BLE being "on" doesn't cut battery life.

> Not sure it is working properly. Everytime I decide to check in on the app, it says battery optimiser is on and it's not working. I then put this on but it goes back to off again. Also there is no way in settings to make sure this app doesn't get this treatment. Ahh!!<br> :date: __2020-06-22 01:48:43__

> Why does it keep stopping? I support the use of this app, but it keeps stopping. Even though battery optimisation is on in my settings, the app keeps requesting I turn optimisation on. After being out for 4 hours yesterday, I found that the app wasn't activated because it had turned itself off. Now if I was in contact with anyone who is diagnosed with covid-19 I'll never know.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 23:39:05__

> Interferes with Bluetooth when using video or audio playback causing pauses in the playback. Samsung s10.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 15:13:59__

> I keep getting flash notifications "connected to null" "disconnected to null". I'm guessing this is the 'handshake'' thing it does. But it's very frustrating. Flashing up every 15-60 seconds. It's come up 8 times while typing this. I don't want to, but I'll have to delete it.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 11:36:10__

> It keeps stopping, several times a day. Seems to be when I'm browsing other apps such as Twitter, Instagram or news. I'm not sure that it's much use anyway, if I need to be near someone for 15 minutes. For example, I went for a flu shot. I waited my turn, sitting 1.5m from other people, for less than 15 minutes. I was in the room with the nurse, up close, getting an injection, for less than 15 minutes. None of those contacts would have been logged.<br> :date: __2020-06-18 01:02:10__

> Whilst it may help keep us safe it does seem to be at the cost of hogging your bluetooth so nothing else will connect properly. As an essential worker I'm traveling into the city every day(a 2 hr trip) and this app means I can't listen to music. If I'm in the car the connection keeps dropping meaning I can't receive calls if I must. The only reason this doesn't get 1 start is that I appreciate it is to try and keep us safe.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 22:29:39__

> Had to uninstall. Constantly stopping and requires manual restart. Too frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 23:18:01__

> Covid safe can't even update itself! Really? Lift your game government!<br> :date: __2020-06-19 07:37:34__

> With the COVIDSafe app installed I'm unable to install updates to any apps through the play store. Some notifications are repeating and others delayed or not received. After uninstalling COVIDSafe app and restarting phone am able to apply Play store updates and notification issues are resolved. I reinstall the app when going out but suspect that my historical data has been lost every time I uninstall the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 06:20:33__

> Just downloaded it, as I've been working from home since beginning of March, and back at work on Monday thought it was best I had it on the phone. But, will see how much battery it uses and how irritating it becomes if it does that is, before I up or down the star rating.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 01:39:35__

> While it's a good idea, battery life is horrible now my phone is flat before 4pm usually 8/9pm before I need to charge my phone. My phone cuts out when using Bluetooth especially music. Sure with all the tech gurus there could be a better system.<br> :date: __2020-06-17 02:44:01__

> Buggy. (Motorola G 3rd Gen Android 6) Seems to work ok for 1 - 3 hours, but time is uncertain as phone rarely leaves my pocket.

> It disappears after a short time. Unreliable<br> :date: __2020-06-22 00:04:08__

> Really WANT to use the app, think it's a good idea but am unable to register. The app doesn't reject my mobile phone number - it tells me it's sent the PIN to my number, which is shown correctly on the screen, but the PIN doesn't arrive. Tried wifi & mobile data, with 0 at front of my number & without, done clean reinstalls, phone (Nokia 6, Android 9) software up to date - no luck. Support unhelpful. UPDATE 23 May: Still can't to register, emails now ignored. 21 JUNE: Still can't register.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 11:18:07__

> Dependent on bluetooth connectivity too much for this app to have it constantly crashing. Always disconnecting from other devices. Uninstalling this app until reviews advise it's working better<br> :date: __2020-06-21 09:29:32__

> Apparently useless. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 03:05:20__

> I'm not happy with the app using Bluetooth they should use the location instead Bluetooth is easy for hackers<br> :date: __2020-06-21 01:57:50__

> Cannot get it my LG Android phone<br> :date: __2020-06-20 12:16:36__

> Whilst the purpose of this app is fantastic it interferes with the playback of music through Bluetooth headphones or the Bluetooth connection in the car. It causes drop outs that last up to 5 or so seconds and this is really frustrating. I uninstalled the app because of this and have only reinstalled it to leave feedback. I will be uninstalling it after this.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 01:15:45__

> 28 versions of this app so far and still not working properly. Nobody stay next to me for less than 4 minutes so pointless having it on. It is on my phone so why do you want it.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 19:02:20__

> App frequently stops. Bluetooth switches off unexpectedly. These issues together with the fact that it depends on close proximity for an extended period of time makes the app ineffective for its intended purpose. As stated elsewhere in these reviews, it only takes the time for a sneeze or a cough to become infected. Still have it installed but not as optimistic as those in power are. A very disappointing app.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 11:45:25__

> Needs to use the Apple-Google API that other countries are adopting because it's the only one that works properly.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 11:28:45__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
