## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Australian Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app) |
| **Email** | support@COVIDSafe.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> A useful app that causes slightly more battery usage but anything that helps to contact trace people potentially affected by the Chinese Communist Party Virus (CCP Virus), is worth having as an additional tool to help fight this Chinese biological weapon. If any good that came from this CCP Virus is that it revealed China's true colours & is helping the rest of the world in unititing in worldwide retribution against the CCP.

> Update on the 23/08 (Version number 1.0.56) is warning me "No internet connection" when my phone is connected to the internet. Tapping the warning takes me to a message on why it needs the internet with a back arrow.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 04:21:40__

> I get why people would be unhappy about the app draining phone batteries. The idea is great... but its bypassing a lot of precautions and restrictions to stay awake and pull bluetooth information (polling), and agressive pinned notifications tend to be the most annoying type. Phone OS updates should help reduce wakelocks Other than that, it doesn't do much beyond tracking bluetooth IDs, like WiFi names, your phone/SIM network has your geo location, google/apple do too. Theyre beyond invasive.<br> :date: __2020-08-22 06:16:41__

> Can i download the covidsafe app on a tablet<br> :date: __2020-08-15 08:03:45__

> It keeps dropping of.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 11:56:57__

> Has been working on Android 6.0.1 until the last few days, when it now requires Battery optimisation to be disabled. I have tried all help instruction and any other possible way to switch off battery optimisation but the COVIDSafe app (v 1.0.48) still will not work. Hope they fix the problem soon.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 07:01:21__

> I know programmers are trying their best but app shows it can't access location. Between blutooth, wifi and nfc can assemble good location lock anyway.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:16:16__

> Was working fine until latest update, accepted the location settings, but now makes my phone (Pixel 2) crash and restart every time I open Google Maps. Had to uninstall so I could use my phone!<br> :date: __2020-08-11 00:37:39__

> Very supportive of the concept. But, after the update, there's an Android notification saying it is not active because it needs location permissions. It does have location permissions. The app itself says it's active. So I have no idea if it's working or not<br> :date: __2020-08-10 23:11:48__

> Why one would change a perfectly good notification icon that made it easy to see whether the app was working or not into an icon with a misleading tick, accompanied by a message saying the app is not working, is beyond my understanding.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 16:43:41__

> I concur with some comments made about the latest update. It seems to use more battery, and there are occasionally issues with Bluetooth functionality. I use a Huawei Y5. My biggest beef is that since adding covidsafe, I have found my Facebook Lite app doesn't work properly. FB can't post or upload photos. Maybe there is a setting on the covidsafe app, which when switched on or off, will fix this annoyance. I wish I knew.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 16:40:30__

> It didn't even send my pin through a.d it's my correct phone number this app needs fixing big time<br> :date: __2020-08-19 23:24:07__

> After latest update unable to use my Bluetooth headphones due to constant cut-outs. Stopping the app fixes that issue.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 10:13:10__

> As of today (13/8) I get alerts that the app isn't active. When I open the app, it decides it's active. When I go into settings, I ensure that it can access location at all times. But I still keep getting this alert. It stops being active when I lock the phone.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 08:20:29__

> Recent update requires location services to be on all the time. This is a deal breaker for me. I will leave it running and hope it continues to work without it (it has permission to access location so all Bluetooth functions work)<br> :date: __2020-08-12 02:49:55__

> I can understand the need for this app, but at the the moment; the cons outweigh the pros. On paper, using our devices to help pinpoint potential hotspots sounds like a good idea. But due to the fact that the app not only needs to always run in the background (even in power saving), it's constant access to location turning a 4day battery into 6 hours and consistent interruption of Bluetooth devices make this more of a hastle, rather then a utility. Please fix the Bluetooth and battery issues<br> :date: __2020-08-12 02:39:32__

> They said it does not require location services. After recent update, does not work without location services "on". Very supportive of the government and the purpose of the app, but I don't allow any app to use my location services unless it is necessary for the use of the app. Your location is not required for the purpose of the app, especially when the government said that it does use your location.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 01:01:06__

> (previously a 5 star review - now changed to 1 star) The app says it's working, but in the notification bar is says "COVIDSafe is not active" - and no matter what settings, permissions or restarting - it won't change. No longer sure if it's keeping me safe from COVID-19 !<br> :date: __2020-08-24 07:01:04__

> Useless.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 06:05:49__

> Not good to register<br> :date: __2020-08-24 03:08:26__

> The app keeps closing itself so it isn't running<br> :date: __2020-08-23 23:37:43__

> Endlessly fails to work and says that its not connected and then whether it's working or not its constantly draining the battery as it won't allow the phone to go into battery save mode, beyond disappointed!<br> :date: __2020-08-23 14:59:09__

> Also issues with bluetooth devices dropping out very regularly. Bluetooth car connection drops momentarily and then reconnects evèry few minutes..<br> :date: __2020-08-23 09:17:32__

> My wife has a 2year old phone that is a system5 she cannot download the app very disappointing why wasn't this looked at before creating this app how many more are out there that cannot down load the app working now thank you after new update<br> :date: __2020-08-23 08:59:13__

> Keeps turning off due to battery optimization software on OPPO Find X2 neo, never had this problem with Samsung galaxy note 8, renders the app useless. I have changed battery optimization setting for both device and app and it is still turning off by battery optimization.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 06:04:10__

> This app is functioning useless, as it relies on users restarting it every so often. Current community usage would be minimal at best. It should be abandoned in it's current form and the government should support citizens using the covid tracing functionality built into Android and IOS. Stop blundering along with this.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 05:44:06__

> until the latest update, this app was a 4. now I would give it 1. it now disconnects my Bluetooth devices every few minutes which is extremely annoying when you are in the middle of a phone call with Bluetooth headset on.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 02:14:48__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Pros: good to know the official safe links here. Cons: it's really just a collection of web links, nothing more.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:47:47__

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
