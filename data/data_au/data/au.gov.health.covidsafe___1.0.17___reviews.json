Have to turn bluetooth off and therefore disable covid safe to be able to use mobile hotspot function which is how I access internet. Not too bad as I mostly tether at home, but it then relies on me remembering to reenable the app and bluetooth before I go out. May get better usage if that bug is addressed.
