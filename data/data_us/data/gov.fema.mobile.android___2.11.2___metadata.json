        "Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad. Also tried to pull up the app while roaming, and got a \"no wifi\" connection error. Who the hell has wifi during an emergency??? DO BETTER.",
        "Poorly targeted and poorly timed notifications that are sent during normal sleep hours - make it necessary to use device settings to stop all notifications from this app. Insufficient app based management of notifications.",
        "Love it!! Can check on family around the country and in different counties. If you set you phone to do not disturb, make sure to tell the do not disturb app that these messages are allowed. If you lower power saving level on android phones the app does not alert you.",
        "The type is thinner and less legible with this update. The unnecessary style change reduces its usefulness to me. Plus, I have not received alerts about the smoke in my area or the fires near me although I specified that in the settings. So I uninstalled it.",
        "Very easy to use. Self explanatory App. Everything is basically right there on the App.",
        "Getting several alerts with little or no lead time. Several other alerts just multiples of previous alerts with no changes in them at all. That's probably FEMA but still downgrades usefulness.",
        "Convenient, very informative, quick acting app",
        "Great information to keep current of the situations.",
        "Doesn't work . Can't scroll on screen or get may location informaton",
        "Overall decent, but I don't need 17 alerts in one hour for the same storm.",
        "It's missing the alerts Snow Squall Warning, Inland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, and Inland Tropical Storm Watch.",
        "Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps",
        "Prepare: emergency safety tips: broken scroll and no clickables",
        "Needs to be GPS enabled. I shouldn't have to create a list of areas to monitor",
        "Works but would multiply the same alerts",
        "Wakes you up randomly at night with repeat information.",
        "Difficult to navigate and doesn't provide info I expected",
        "Very complete and easy to use",
        "Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting \"red flag warnings\" and \"evacuation alerts\" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like \"GO NOW Eden Road\" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.",
        "Not enough details on alerts. Not worth the space on my phone",
        "App should work as a REAL emergency service! No wifi or data usage! With today's technology & the dangerous times we r living in as well as facing especially with riots & illness! This app is put on by OUR GOVERNMENT!! IT SHOULD WORK FLAWLESSLY!! I think y'all r paid enough to PROTECT US! YOU SHOULD DO YOUR JOB!!! So sick n tired of the buck being passed & the excuses! YOU WANTED UR JOB SO DO IT! OR FIND ANOTHER!",
        "The app has had its ups and downs, but it was working for a while. Now it has stopped sending notifications, which makes it useless unless you want to open the app and check each location to see if there have been any alerts. The point is to GET the alerts, not have to keep checking to see if there have been any. 12/18/18 Still was not getting a single alert... Uninstalled, downloaded again -- working now!",
        "No notification alarm!!",
        "Be alert is the best way to live I likeWeather alerts, safety tips and more to help before, during & after disasters. Emergency alerts, safety tips and resources to help before, during & after disasters. The FEMA App provides timely alerts and useful information to help you and your loved ones stay safe before, during and after disasters. Receive and share real-time notifications about disasters, severe weather, and other emergencies for up to five locations nationwide. This simple and easy-to",
        "The app should work off line. I cannot use the app with cellular data. Alerts set to my location only notify me when I have Wi-Fi and completely disappear if I'm not connected. How is this convenient during a disaster?",
        "this app is good. it needs adjustment though. i need to be able to turn off vibration and sound alerts. i was woken up at 730am because the app wanted me to know the roads were slick. this was really annoying because i turned off the winter weather alerts, knowing that this kind of thing would happen on a daily basis because i live in a snowy area. i want this app to alert me when there is an emergency, not an everyday weather happenstance.",
        "I guess I haven't paid much attention because I also get alerts in other ways but this app doesn't appear to be sending me notifications anymore. The only reason I noticed this now is because the Google Play store gave me a notification there was an update. I am subscribed to all alerts for two different locations so I am not sure what the value of this app is currently. Edit: Thanks. This is now fixed.",
        "I have used this app for a couple of years now and really like this app! Especially during times when dangerous weather is wreaking havoc! It has also came in handy for alerting friends and family in other parts of the country to evacuation orders and other dangers. *An improvement I would like to see (if possible) is the ability to change the notification sound - It currently uses whatever the phones default notification is. Not a real big deal, but would be nice.",
        "I'm happy that I finally found a disaster app that notifies me of disasters. None of the others worked. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I don't always know about those alerts. I can't set the alert tone, so often, when they come in, I don't know about them. It's a shame. If it wasn't for that this would be the definitive app. But even with that failing, it's still the only disaster app I'll ever want",
        "No alerts, even though Weather Underground published this this morning. Not a peep out of my Android cell FEMA app. even though I subscribed to this alert.   The National Weather Service in Upton has issued a Small Craft Advisory, which is in effect from 6 AM to 6 PM EDT Friday.  * WINDS...Northwest winds 10 to 20 kt with gusts up to 25 kt.  PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...  A Small Craft Advisory means that sustained wind speeds or frequent gusts of 25 to 33 kt and/or seas of 5 ft or higher are expected or occurring, and hazardous to small craft. Inexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller vessels, should avoid navigating in these conditions.  Registered app for 06405 Branford.",
        "Hasn't been updated in months. The first time I opened it, it crashed. I ran it again and with no clear instructions, found it difficult to use. Too complicated and and has unnecessary stuff for a simple weather alert app. I recommend the Red Cross app if you just want notifications and not a complete weather app.",
        "This app is great for storm season, and off season. The app provides timely alerts. The problems I have are 1. I sleep through my message tone. Customisable alert tones, maybe a different tone for each section, would make sure I receive life saving alerts in the middle of the night. Fix that and I'll give 5 stars 2. Less important is a radar map.",
        "You can receive alerts for multiple areas. The app has everything from weather alerts to information on disaster preparedness. I've not used but you can also call 911 with it.",
        "Great at giving alerts for different areas. Live posting during storms is excellent. Just be careful you don't list to many places to avoid constant updates.",
        "A tornado watch was issued by this app in the notification bar!!! No sounds at all!! A wind chime with a video stream would be more useful than this app is. Spoken warnings preceded by an audible alarm that alert you to locations/counties under a watch or warning (as it use to be), should be mandatory on all weather apps. Access to NOAA Radio/National Weather Service alerts and conditions for your current location should not be hard to find, as these are funded by taxes.",
        "A good app from the government? Shocker. In all seriousness it's actually very useful. I like being able to keep updated on the town my family lives in as well as where I am now. I used to use the \"Emergency\" app from the Red Cross for this purpose. However this app is better because it shows less severe alerts. For example I live in a low lying area so it's good to get flood notifications, even if it's just a watch. Same with high surf warnings. The Red Cross app only shows high level alerts.",
        "I would give it a zero, but that's not an option. I just found out about this app, and being in the path of hurricane Dorian, thought it would be a good app to have. However, it doesn't search/recognize my location when i try to enter it for alerts, making it pretty useless to me. Edited to add: after the 5th install, i was finally able to add a location, so i bumped up the stars.",
        "Lots of great information! Thank you for all that has been done by FEMA, whether our weather conditions, being at the ground level of a hurricane helping people get out, assisting those in need of financial help, or something amazing like this app!!! This app has checklists, your location list of possible disasters, and even has texts to set up for warnings/information. What a blessing! Thanks for all the work yall do!",
        "reply: I did have my location set, had the app for 6 months and NOTHING! No blizzard warnings (had 3 with the app), no thunderstorm warnings (had at least 20 of those with the app), no severe wind warning (had too many of those to count). With the gps turned on, it located my house on the map instantly. IDK how I can trust this app to download again. using weatherbug. I get alerts from them all the time. At least THEY are reliable.",
        "Extremely well covers high pop centers. However, little to no coverage in rural areas. We live in Benton County, MO...no coverage ANYWHERE here."
