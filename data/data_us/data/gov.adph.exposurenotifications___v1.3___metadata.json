The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family\u2019s and your community\u2019s. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsing the app is easy: \r\n\r\nStep one: Download the GuideSafe\u2122 Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. \r\n\r\nStep two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. \r\n\r\nStep three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won\u2019t know who or where.

        "Doesn't alert exposure accurately. My friend tested positive, she had the app, bluetooth on, and had exposure turned on in her iPhone's settings. We hung out at dinner for about an hour the day before she tested and put the positive result in the app and it's been 8 days since then and I have not received a notification of the positive result. My Bluetooth was on and I have had the app properly functioning as well. This is a big problem and the fault is not on me or my friend.",
        "As odd as this may sound but this app is causing my mobile Hotspot app from broadcasting but occasionally it will broadcast but by the time I try and connect it has \"disappeared.\" On my phone (Note 10 plus) it doesn't have any errors and looks normal but none of my electronics sees my wifi. I could not figure it out until I disabled this app and immediately I could see my wifi again. I can repeat this issue every time I enabled this app (Bluetooth). I don't use the Bluetooth wifi Hotspot so idk",
        "Downloaded 4 days ago. My roommate downloaded app at the same time, but from the apple app store. Their app posts regular updates on how often it has checked for exposure, whilst mine still says \"never checked for exposure,\" despite having given app all permissions and keeping BT and location turned on. One of us reported a positive test, and the other was never notified of exposure, despite sharing a car and house. My sister was exposed from being on a family trip with us, yet no notification",
        "Notification of exposure gave 0 information. Also, it notified me 6 DAYS AFTER EXPOSURE???? I had strongly supported this app in the beginning but now I'm concerned why it seemed to \"lag\" on my notification time and also lack information such as distance from the person, time spent near them, etc. LIKE IT SHOWED IN PRESENTATIONS? What a disappointment",
        "Notification gives no information! I was notified of a possible exposure, but the app only told me the day. It did not tell me how long or at what distance as it's website says it will. Given I wore a mask everywhere, I don't feel I really need to quarantine for 14 days based on an app that so few people have even downloaded! Please give more information if you expect me to take your recommendation to quarantine seriously!",
        "Giving a 3 star review now because I've not used this app on an Android device. I have both Android and iPhone devices. Upon reading reviews of when using on Android devices, as opposed to iPhone devices, I know my iPhone works in real time notifications. Update was recently done on this application, so I'm going to give it a try. He!l, in reality even it notifying a few days later is better than NOT BEING NOTIFIED AT ALL. I will update with a comparison review. Stay safe, do the right thing masks don't hurt ya, and vote. Truly, Your Fellow American",
        "No issues downloading. I agree with a previous review, it would be more useful if it was utilized by more people. But i do feel better that this tool is avaliable! Thanks.",
        "I can't reactivate after updated. Now after I check permissions boxes when I click on enable it says \"Internal e0rror, please try again.\"",
        "Terrible. Because of issues with this app, i cannot get into any of the buildings at my school. I couldn't even eat today because of it. There are universities that require this app to be working correctly in order to even be on campus. Problems like this are unacceptable.",
        "It would be awesome if more people download and use this app. Even though it doesn't seem widely used yet, I fell much better knowing more about my risk exposure.",
        "Not accurate in the least!!!! Good intentions, but poorly executed.",
        "Asks for phone # everytime and never sends a reminder. The worst of 3 daily covid apps I use.",
        "Glad we're able to expand sharing of this secure, very effective app. The more it's used, the stronger our mutual protection becomes - so PLEASE PASS IT ALONG!!!",
        "I have this app with Bluetooth on. I have found out I've been exposed and they have the app... and crickets. Nothing.",
        "Great Idea. Thank you. It is at the top of my list of worries. With my age and health issues.",
        "No issues. Does this share exposure notifications with the other notification apps or only with users of this app?",
        "Took 45 seconds to download and set up. Easy-peasy",
        "Everyone in Alabama needs to download this. It doesn't work at all. If you catch covid and use this app you get to sue the developer as well as the state of Alabama. Definitely a better payout than a stimulus check.",
        "Seems functional; better late than never",
        "Works but Annoyed - had this for UAB support, though it kept saying I had been exposed, the problem my phone was charging at the time it said the exposure happened on 2 different days at the same time of day (late Sunday evenings) I didn't go anywhere during those timeframes. It has to be binging off one of my neighbors but I had to quarantine and not attend classes. I've now removed it.",
        "App questionnaire requires email verification, but doesn't work, so don't bother. If that basic feature does not work then how can you rely on it to correctly perform contact tracing?! This is not an in consequential function. Get it right!",
        "I agree.. It would be awesome if everyone would download and use this app.",
        "I live in Colorado, reading a local news story and this app pops up, annoying on that level, but moving on, I'm like heck yeah, I want to be informed about Covid locally. As the app is installing it shows it's for Alabama?!?!? How does that help me in Colorado? Pop ups are annoying to begin with, but if you're going to do it, at least get the state correct. If you can't get that right, I'm not going to put a lot of stock in your other life changing information.",
        "Can't even get past the privacy screen, pressing the more button does nothing.",
        "This is not reporting properly",
        "We need this in society, this would help us a lot in America. Although all the comments say it's not accurate, but the reason I posted a five star review is because if they update this to work properly then everyone can at least consider using this to reduce Covid-19.",
        "The app Interferes with mobile internet. I could not use my mobile internet service with this app installed.",
        "So happy Alabama released a covid contact tracing app!",
        "Legitimately did not download this app, it just showed up on my phone this morning. No clue why or how but super sketchy.",
        "It would work better if more people had it on their phones.",
        "The absolute state of Pandemic politicization. Hear me now: I don't fear the plague. I fear the government and private sector for whom their belief in synthetic solutions divide us from our rights like a the wake of a speedboat.",
        "I had seen all the first app I dl All Covids Shouldnt have No Tracng On All Apps",
        "Its crock dont doenload it. Better apps than this. You can not uninstall it it hides its location and name",
        "Great idea I hope it catches on.",
        "Eh Um.... HMMM 1# question tho why this app 4 all the phone's?.. Just wondering...",
        "So I been exposed to 15 people today huh.. so they just saying they positive for the hell of to scare people",
        "Easy to use.",
        "Don't work",
        "I hope many people download it!",
        "Seems pretty safe."
