# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> Thank you for taking an active role in slowing the spread of coronavirus and making a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community.  Care19 uses state-of-the-art GPS location data to help trace the places you have visited.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19, with your permission, this anonymous and confidential data can be shared with the Department of Health to more efficiently identify others with whom you were in contact with.  Identifying contacts is key to slowing the spread of coronavirus.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |
| **Email** | tim.brookins@proudcrowd.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Has great potential. However, during a pandemic you would think devs would update the content occasionally. Covid19 facts and stats worldwide are changing by the moment. This app hasn't updated since I downloaded it early last week making this app pointless and not relevant.

<br>CRUSH COVID RI also connects you to the latest COVID-19 news and resources – and helps you quickly check for symptoms and identify testing locations near you. Together we will #CrushCovidRI!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy install. All you need is to enable gps permissions. Location data is saved on the phone and you can review the locations you went to. I found you can turn off the tracking mg in the settings by pulling down the menu, swiping left on the crush covid icon, and click the clog. Then toggle the button to disable. There needs to be a way to turn on and off easier from the top pull down menu. This will allow users to turn off when at home to save battery.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 02:17:51__

> Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 00:18:42__

> Not exactly accurate. It didn't record my trips on the morning of 5/22nd. I thought this was supposed to be up to date tracking<br> :date: __2020-05-22 19:15:46__

> Good information, however, the location is not very accurate.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 16:08:09__

> According to the app's tracking history, I was at an address for 53 minutes, which I wasn't. I didn't even go by that address.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:55:05__

> Informative and useful ap. Easy to use. Unfortunately it interfered with the location on Pokemon Go so I had to uninstall it.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 02:55:09__

> I think the point of this app is great. And I don't know if it's my phone or the app but I have been home all day today yet it says I have been to places up the street from me. Like I said, it could be my phone. This hasn't just happened today, but other days too.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 22:06:35__

> Barely tracks my location, only registered an hour of time and completely missed me leaving the house. Ten minute window is also far to broad.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 17:28:08__

> At first the app seemed to function well with some useful information. However it doesn't work with a VPN enabled. When I try looking at My Location Diary with it says it needs wifi/cellular network. Why is it failing when the VPN is enabled? Why is it going to a server for data when the location diary is supposed to be stored on my phone?<br> :date: __2020-05-20 23:46:46__

> Telling me places haven't been, stupid<br> :date: __2020-05-20 21:18:17__

> Doesn't always respond<br> :date: __2020-05-20 00:29:08__

> Does not work! I have not left my house since I downloaded it, yet it states I have been in 5 different places! I uninstalled it!<br> :date: __2020-05-22 18:10:29__

> Won't download😠😠<br> :date: __2020-05-22 13:48:07__

> It said I was at a location for 53 minutes that I passed by on a ride but it won't say I was home for the 10 hours while working<br> :date: __2020-05-22 00:42:43__

> Doesn't go beyond choosing a language<br> :date: __2020-05-21 22:50:11__

> Locations are not correct.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 03:29:13__

> The my location diary is not very useful if it's only going to register somewhere I've been for 10 minutes or more. It takes less then a second for somebody to cough or sneeze on you. I went to 3 places today and only one registered in my diary. One of the places that did not register had a worker who was not wearing a face mask. So this place would have been the highest likelihood to get me sick and I wouldn't have been able to track it and the DOH would have inaccurate information.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 02:41:04__

> I Do not consent to the state tracking me.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:53:16__

> I get why RI wanted to have something sooner rather than later but this app does not follow the standard conventions and frameworks the major contact tracing applications use. Rather than use BLE to ping anonymous IDs for _proxity_ detection they are storing your full location history locally.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 17:02:04__

> Highly insecure and unstable. References non-specific security policies, absent HIPAA compliance. Provides examples of some information, not all information collected<br> :date: __2020-05-20 15:55:42__

> While I understand and appreciate the good will and intent behind the creation of this app, the implementation is severely flawed. Using a persistent foreground service with GPS lock is going to significantly drain users battery, to the point where this app will likely become less useful as devices enter battery saving mode or simply turn off. I believe there are better and more user-friendly ways to introduce an experience like this that balance good will while preserving device resources.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 15:03:38__
