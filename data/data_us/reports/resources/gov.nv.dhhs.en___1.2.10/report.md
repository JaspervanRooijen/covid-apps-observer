## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> 5 stars because this is one of the best smart phone / bluetooth applications anybody has thought of so far. One thing I would like to see are statistics about the number of Bluetooth pairings that the app performed. Installation was without problems for me.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 21:50:35__

> Great idea. This needs to be advertised more!<br> :date: __2020-08-25 19:06:56__

> Won't even get past the 3rd setup page....I hope Nevada did not actually pay somebody to build this. Tried again after update ..still will not set up....3rd update did the trick. set up OK ..upped to 3 stars. We will see.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 11:15:50__

> Drains your battery! I dont like to have my bluetooth on all day. I am in the medical field and am exposed to know's what, so oy would be interesting to see if i am exposed at work. Just wished it didn't drain my battery<br> :date: __2020-08-31 17:45:38__

> This app is such an awesome start. It has never updated exposure on it's own. I have to refresh it every time. I have gone a day with no auto updates like it said it would, so I just refresh at least once a day. I wish it showed how many ids you have encountered or something cause it feels like the app isn't doing anything. It would be nice to know that it has read # nearby users and is now checking that many every refresh. It kinda feels like just an info about covid app, not a tracker.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 19:31:12__

> The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 20:20:58__

> So the app is working dled at 5am you swipe to reload the screached 0 encounters so i think this use app is very low at this point all change review as data is available im using a stylo 5<br> :date: __2020-08-25 16:10:50__

> Have the latest updates, yet asks me to update further. Click the link to do so > infinite load screen. Much needed app, needs some fixes.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 08:51:36__

> Needs work, won't refresh!<br> :date: __2020-09-18 02:17:18__

> DOES NOT AUTO UPDATE.<br> :date: __2020-09-07 14:37:16__

> I installed this app on 8/30/2020. Location and BlueTooth are on. Exposure notifications are on. I received on Exposure Notification on 8/30/2020 at 12:20pm saying No Exposure Found in the last hour. As of 8/31/2020, 12:01pm I have not received any other exposure notices. Even after one hour in the gym. 1) Why isn't this running/working? and 2)How do I manually check for exposures? 3)How frequently should I get exposures? Using a Samsung Note 8, android. Installation seemed to go just fine. Sending question to help email noted below. I very much would like to see this app be successful!<br> :date: __2020-08-31 21:09:02__

> This doesn't work, the app itself looks/seems/feels like a toy or fake, won't even show in the google play search, I had to find the website first then use the link to get to the app and in my girlfriend phone wont pass from the 3rd page "next" Samsung A20, and in my Samsung gs8 the loading update it's "meh".<br> :date: __2020-08-27 04:14:38__

> I love this idea! But... It only shows that the last check was 15 hours ago. One check is all it has done. What good is that? For those stuck on 3rd page, slide the slider in middle of the page as instructions say.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 16:09:15__

> doesn't tell you anything cause no one is reporting thru the app.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 23:40:48__

> I downloaded this app and thought it was ok at first until I noticed that the last time it scanned had been days before at the same time but it kept telling me that I had no exposures within the past hour.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 13:58:51__

> The only reason we're not getting alerts is because nobody in nevada has used this app (yet) to report their exposure/positive covid19 result(s).<br> :date: __2020-09-16 16:39:01__

> A joke. The app almost never updates. You could be all around people with covid and would never know. This app is totally pointless<br> :date: __2020-08-31 03:53:05__

> Can't get past the third page of setup<br> :date: __2020-08-26 06:12:39__

> In get started portion before i can use app, it will not respond to CONTINUE button on 3rd page after watching 37 second video. I CAN'T GET PAST THIS. HELP PLEASE.. Using Android 9 from Google play store.<br> :date: __2020-08-26 01:12:32__

> Can't get beyond the continue which is blacked out except for a small clear patch. Another person had the same problem and said the programmer showed him how to get beyond that point. Unfortunately he didn't bother to tell what it was<br> :date: __2020-08-25 22:30:38__

> Once I downloaded it and entered by email mail address and password I got a message something like thanks for your purchase?<br> :date: __2020-08-25 06:08:19__

> Wont install on a Galaxy S20.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 02:09:08__

> This app downloaded and installed. Can't locate on my galaxy s8. If I can find it, I'm going to trash it where it belongs.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 02:00:58__
