### Description
> Thank you for taking an active role in slowing the spread of coronavirus and making a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community.  Care19 uses state-of-the-art GPS location data to help trace the places you have visited.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19, with your permission, this anonymous and confidential data can be shared with the Department of Health to more efficiently identify others with whom you were in contact with.  Identifying contacts is key to slowing the spread of coronavirus.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section of the app.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Need to have a way to add places one has been when it quite often misses the place one had visited all together.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 02:16:21__

> This app doesn't work very well. Sometimes places I've been will show up but I have gone places that do not show up. This type of app needs to be much more reliable.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 01:32:49__

> I have had this ap downloaded for a week and it has only captured visits to my office. I went to Target and Walmart both for at least one hour during this time. It also did not record a visit to my chiropractor, but that was only 15 minutes total. I downloaded this to be a good citizen and help protect myself and others, but it clearly is not working. I have a Galaxy Note 10. I didn't see another way to offer feedback.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 20:53:36__

> Location services on and did not log 4 businesses we were at on 4/28. Yet logs places we only drove by. Android version 2.1 on Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Hope this helps. Turned notifications off.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 05:08:46__

> Pretty much a pain to use, might be easier to log locations manually.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 21:00:07__

> Gives a lot of erroneous locations that are passed while driving or stopping at a stop light.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 02:30:37__

> Quit recording places after one day not help anywhere<br> :date: __2020-04-30 01:53:49__

> Has not logged anything sense the 25th of April and have gone to work for 2 8 hour shifts plus trip to grocery store<br> :date: __2020-04-29 04:45:01__

> It works but Google maps does the same thing with timeline<br> :date: __2020-04-26 09:14:04__

> Location info is incorrect and incomplete. I was able to fix the incorrect info, but can't add locations.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 21:37:04__

> The only place the app consistently logs is where I work, and it doesn't log that until I come back to work after lunch around 1 pm. Today I went to 3 different stores and it didn't log any of them, those are the most important locations to be logged. I've been using the app since it became available in South Dakota and this has been my experience from the start.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 00:54:52__

> This app does not log any of the locations I have been. Do not know how to correct.this. delete and reinstall?<br> :date: __2020-05-09 19:17:40__

> Does not keep accurate tracing. Places I have been are not being recorded, but it records places I have not been.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:27:13__

> Is not exact location of where I was do not like it at all and I am always up dating my app for it to work If i have to update this thing again and it looks like i have to i am deleting it should not have to make sure it is working right before leaving my house<br> :date: __2020-05-08 15:46:39__

> It doesn't work. Yesterday I went to 2 places and neither was captured. Last week the same thing.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 06:18:44__

> It does not ever log the places I have been at.<br> :date: __2020-05-07 19:42:14__

> Has not recorded anything since end of april<br> :date: __2020-05-07 13:36:34__

> It did not track at all.<br> :date: __2020-05-07 03:15:55__

> The app still does not log all stop. I drove into Fargo and I was stopped for more than 10 minutes and it did not log it at all<br> :date: __2020-05-06 16:25:40__

> I uninstalled it because it doesn't always record places I visit. I was at the YMCA for 45 minutes and it didn't add it.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 16:21:58__
