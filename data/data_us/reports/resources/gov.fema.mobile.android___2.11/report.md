## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I would give it a zero, but that's not an option. I just found out about this app, and being in the path of hurricane Dorian, thought it would be a good app to have. However, it doesn't search/recognize my location when i try to enter it for alerts, making it pretty useless to me. Edited to add: after the 5th install, i was finally able to add a location, so i bumped up the stars.<br> :date: __2019-09-01 03:46:38__

> FEMA is supposed to be the lead agency in responding to a national disaster. Under Donald Trump's direction, FEMA was defunded to pay for his wall. The appropriate leadership resigned or were fired, and the money went towards paying for his wall. Now this useless app is nothing but Trump appointees patting Trump on the back and calling him a good boy when they should be directing resources to help Americans.
