### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Rhode Island |
| **Website**  | [https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid](https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid) |
| **Email** | CrushCovid.Survey@health.ri.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> Resident of Rhode Island<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:39:10__

> if you don't see the icon, it's not tracking you.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 23:43:54__

> Happy with it, but wish it had: - lower battery drain - visual display of location tracing Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-06-08 19:14:53__

> Cannot get contact tracing in Crush Colvid<br> :date: __2020-08-10 20:35:33__

> Not totally accurate<br> :date: __2020-07-16 21:44:22__

> Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:41:15__

> James Wadsworth I have found the tracking to be only 75 per cent accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 06:40:02__

> I mean, I get that the app is trying it's best, but it only works in Rhode island! The better news is that at least it warns u what states the coronavirus are tracked<br> :date: __2020-07-11 03:50:12__

> Not accurate or up to date. Last night, I grabbed some takeout and then drove to a park by the ocean to eat it. App says I spent almost two hours at Game Stop (the restaurant is where Game Stop used to be.....4 years ago....)<br> :date: __2020-07-03 18:29:50__

> Shows me at my neighbor's house instead of mine Number of hours shown in day for locations add to more or less than 24<br> :date: __2020-06-27 21:17:46__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Uodate: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing g shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-06-27 15:30:01__

> Better, but did not kmow it had to be active on my screen to be working. Needs an option to be a tive in the background.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:26:44__

> Connect to sarahlandry coronavirous<br> :date: __2020-06-11 01:25:17__

> The location is not accurate most of the time. And everytime I try to submit how I feel today, I get an error. I wish it would let you edit the location<br> :date: __2020-08-06 13:28:54__

> Doesnt work. Keeps saying I'm not connected to the internet. Data and location settings are correct.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:42:15__

> Warning! At least on Android phone, you must manually restart the app after restarting your phone.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 00:05:59__

> Location is way off, not accurate at all<br> :date: __2020-07-18 14:39:33__

> I am rooting for this app. But there are several problems: 1) I can't access the new version on my Android phone, the "Let's go" button doesn't seem to work when trying to boot up the app the first time. 2) I wish it would just keep itself running and send my info continuously, once I have given it permission (I often forget to log in and then it stops sending updates). I know it's trying to respect privacy, but there should be an option for those who don't mind to just let it do it's thing.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 21:26:13__

> Gave version 2.0 a try. Went to a Warwick restaurant for 1.5 hours. There is no record of this in "My Location Diary". I really wanted this version to work. I don't understand how the basic and essential functionality doesn't work properly.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 01:38:57__

> Version 1.5 for Android next to useless. All locations are wrong. Governor on Friday 7/10 said 2.0 was released but no sign of it on Google play store.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 21:04:24__

> Location diary inaccuracy. There are days missing in history when i know i was out in area.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 20:19:44__

> Not accurate. Needs a feature for correcting addresses. Not compatible with the covid tracker that was placed on cell phones.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 08:36:38__

> I've had this app on my phone for about a month now and I assumed it was keeping track of where I go, apparently that isn't the case because it's only showing two places in a month which is wrong. I also stopped keeping a contact diary after downloading the app and now I will have a hard time remembering everywhere I've been the past month. Luckily I stay home a lot more than I used to but it's not showing any markets or stores I've been to. I think I'm just going to delete the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-29 20:04:33__

> PLEASE REFACTOR LOCATION TRACKING! Perhaps the sensing approach met privacy goals, battery drain etc., but it's not delivering and some courage is needed (leadership) to face the reality and use or license someone else's proven working tracing approach. (And having to load app manually and keep in a foreground process all the time is plain daffy! When I happen to remember and do it, the location data it gathers is more wrong than right...)<br> :date: __2020-08-16 17:20:13__

> Racist fear mongering app<br> :date: __2020-08-08 17:43:15__

> Didnt work<br> :date: __2020-08-06 19:57:23__

> Not recording anything<br> :date: __2020-07-26 22:25:27__

> Useless and intrusive. A secret way for Ramondo (D) to spy on her constituents and keep them in line. BIG BROTHER/SISTER!!!<br> :date: __2020-07-21 13:45:19__

> I have an LG Aristo 2 Plus. App worked great for 1 month. Then it stopped working. When I hit Send after putting in my zip code, it reads:. "Cannot submit data. Please try again.". I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times. Contacted T Mobile. They checked my phone and say it was the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 22:55:42__

> No location tracking to be seen since the update to 2.0<br> :date: __2020-07-19 21:08:14__

> The location diary is a joke - records places that I have never been near. This is disturbing as I only downloaded for purposes of contact tracing. If tracers were to go by my diary they would be doing a lot of unnecessary work - and, I would hate to be contacted based upon inaccurate data in other users diary. VERSION 2.0 LOCATION DIARY IS WORSE THAN V1.5. HAS ME IN PLACES THAT I LOOKED UP, BUT NEVER WENT TO, IN GOOGLE MAPS. ALSO, HAS ME AT HOME FOR 23HR, 59MIN ONE DAY BUT I TRAVELED TO MA.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 04:46:09__

> Failed to save my data<br> :date: __2020-07-18 18:48:21__

> This app is not accurate at all. It will put you two miles from your actual location. It had me at an elementary school in Coventry when I was at Walgreens in West Warwick. When I am home it says I'm in Barrington on the other side of the bay. I'm pretty sure accuracy is important.<br> :date: __2020-07-16 20:27:29__
