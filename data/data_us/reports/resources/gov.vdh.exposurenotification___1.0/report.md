### Description
> COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia‚Äôs Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 
<br>How COVIDWISE Works: 
<br>If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 
<br>The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
<br>VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia‚Äôs COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | VDH |
| **Website**  | [http://covidwise.org](http://covidwise.org) |
| **Email** | covidwise@vdh.virginia.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets.

> Seems like a wonderful idea, but I was just curious if this program would only work for V.A residents? Because I am about 20 minutes away from the border, but I live in WV.

> I appreciate the efforts to curb the spread of Covid. However when I turned off my phone's location, I received a notification from Google's Exposure Notifications framework that I needed to enable location in order for the app to work. What??? Covidwise says that "No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app." I've since learned that while the app itself doesn't ask for location, Google's Exposure Notification framework (used by the app) obtains location data by using Bluetooth. This is very confusing. Please work out the kinks in messaging this. Otherwise it looks like the app is trying to do something sneaky (trying to gather and store my location data without telling me).<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:49:11__

> For battery optimization issue, you can add this app in the "whitelist" so you won't run into the issue.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 17:11:11__

I'm in Florida where these cases are üòµüòµüí´üí´... But it seems like an easy interface to use, and wish Florida could develop something like this. And even if they did, I would really hope people would give honest reports, but that may just be wishful thinking.

I'll randomly get a notification that my C ovidwize notifications have been enabled only to discover it hasn't been scanning for the last couple of weeks.<br> :date: __2020-10-27 14:52:37__

> Just download zo need some time<br> :date: __2020-10-18 01:28:01__

> Location services must be on for android devices to enable blue tooth, which is a huge drawback for me. I rarely have that turned on, and am selective as to when I have my cell radio on. It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...<br> :date: __2020-10-08 15:33:54__

> I've been using this for over 1 hour and still did not find any Pokemon. as to the app, it seems to draw down the battery. unfortunate not enough potential users, and the "where - when" for contacts seems seriously lacking. still have it running because it's all that's offered.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 05:06:02__

> I like the idea but not sure if it's working on all Samsung devices correctly. I believe s9+ is shutting down due to "Optimizing Battery Usage". Need to shut this off or it won't run in background to work. Need more information to consumers most probably don't know.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 16:44:56__

> It's ridiculous that there are only state apps. I live in California and I don't see an app for me. Also what about people who cross state lines? There needs to be a unified federal App, but I can't see it happening.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 20:53:23__

> I think yall should makw this app for arkansas tbh my state hasent made one and downloading this app and it using my location will it pickup exposure here in ark?<br> :date: __2020-09-12 04:00:25__

> Doesn't use location, but requires location services to be on to work. I leave mine off when not in use, because most other apps aren't so privacy-conscious. By requiring GPS, this app creates security concerns that outweigh its benefits. While THIS app isn't directly compromising my privacy, its permissions requirements open a privacy hole for OTHER apps to use. Android *doesn't* require location for Bluetooth or BLE (I use both), but it unfortunately does for this app's BLE tag tracking.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:56:12__

Believe me if they're doing that they could care less anyway so they're not going to put it in the app. It's like putting a sign on their back and walk around.
