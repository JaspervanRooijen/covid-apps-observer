## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> Great app !!!!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 02:06:16__

> Overall decent, but I don't need 17 alerts in one hour for the same storm.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 01:10:21__

> I took care of a FEMA worker so I thought I would check out app<br> :date: __2020-07-27 23:49:33__

> It's missing the alerts Snow Squall Warning, Inland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, and Inland Tropical Storm Watch.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 22:57:25__

> Fast reliablie services<br> :date: __2020-07-09 01:04:27__

> Great app.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 08:50:11__

> Great at giving alerts for different areas. Live posting during storms is excellent. Just be careful you don't list to many places to avoid constant updates.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 03:22:06__

> Only worth downloading if you're in a disaster situation. Otherwise it's not very useful.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 06:10:43__

> Extremely well covers high pop centers. However, little to no coverage in rural areas. We live in Benton County, MO...no coverage ANYWHERE here.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 15:48:47__

> Also I build homeless shelters and I think this would be the place to add my location make it official<br> :date: __2020-10-06 07:13:34__

> Works but would multiply the same alerts<br> :date: __2020-10-03 19:46:59__

> Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad. Also tried to pull up the app while roaming, and got a "no wifi" connection error. Who the hell has wifi during an emergency??? DO BETTER.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 18:35:21__

> Not enough details on alerts. Not worth the space on my phone<br> :date: __2020-09-11 00:11:01__

> Prepare: emergency safety tips: broken scroll and no clickables<br> :date: __2020-09-08 02:54:56__

> Difficult to navigate and doesn't provide info I expected<br> :date: __2020-09-06 08:45:22__

> The type is thinner and less legible with this update. The unnecessary style change reduces its usefulness to me. Plus, I have not received alerts about the smoke in my area or the fires near me although I specified that in the settings. So I uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 06:13:51__

> No notification alarm!!<br> :date: __2020-08-13 18:12:50__

> where's the warnings I used to get<br> :date: __2020-06-24 02:29:53__

> The back button does not exit the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-09 16:17:55__

> Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps<br> :date: __2020-09-19 20:23:31__

> Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

> What is it with this app. I've.been trying to download it for three days how long does it take to for it to download .we are about to be hit with a hurracain.this is messed.up<br> :date: __2020-08-23 03:40:24__

> Getting several alerts with little or no lead time. Several other alerts just multiples of previous alerts with no changes in them at all. That's probably FEMA but still downgrades usefulness.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 21:22:25__

> This app did not help me.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 19:14:29__

> It really does do absolutely nothing. Not even sure why i have it<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:16:55__

> Alerts are way too excessive.. It's a little windy in my area and I get notifications what feel like every 5 minutes. Had to delete the app because it was so annoying.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 21:47:54__

> It's a weather alert app. I'm getting constant weather alerts during a pandemic lockdown<br> :date: __2020-03-29 17:05:00__

> When I click on "Alerts," I get a message saying that I have to enable them in the app settings. But when I get into the settings, I can't find anything that does that.<br> :date: __2020-03-21 20:10:32__

> App does not give alerts. At one time it worked.<br> :date: __2019-06-18 03:25:56__

This app is put on by OUR GOVERNMENT!! IT SHOULD WORK FLAWLESSLY!! I think y'all r paid enough to PROTECT US! YOU SHOULD DO YOUR JOB!!! So sick n tired of the buck being passed & the excuses!
