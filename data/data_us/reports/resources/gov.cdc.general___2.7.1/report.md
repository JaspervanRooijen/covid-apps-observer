## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |
| **Website**  | [http://www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov) |
| **Email** | CDCMobileDevelopment@cdc.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Need rolling updates to keep the information fresh.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 17:00:11__

> Ever since the COVID-19 Coronavirus struck the U.S., I want to be more informed and so I installed the CDC app so I can be so. Unfortunately for me however, everytime I tap on notifications fron this app, this app fails to display the news article it notified me about within the app once it starts it.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 23:42:01__

> I think it is a great idea and it's definitely one that should be improved upon. The app falls short in information and in many ways it's easier to navigate the CDC website. Local alerts and information would greatly increase the useful aspects of the app.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 01:32:17__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:22:50__

> This damn app doesn't exit<br> :date: __2020-04-23 08:54:01__

> Use the website it is far superior, this app has a blatant lack of organization, however does contain useful information.<br> :date: __2020-04-19 03:08:59__

> THE APP IS NOT OPENING UP TO THE PAGES THAT ARE LINKED WITH THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION . ITS A BLANK WHITE PAGE MY ISP INTERNET CONNECTION IS WORKING FINE. ITS YOUR APP NOT WORKING FRIDAY IT WORKED SEVERAL DAYS AGO, BUT NOW ITS USELESS<br> :date: __2020-04-14 22:23:39__

> Good information, But sends several push messages every day and there is no obvious way to turn them off. Makes it a virus in my book. Uninstalled<br> :date: __2020-04-13 22:01:35__

> 🚮<br> :date: __2020-04-06 00:58:13__

> Great content, but app bogs my phone down.<br> :date: __2020-04-04 06:13:31__

> Has great potential. However, during a pandemic you would think devs would update the content occasionally. Covid19 facts and stats worldwide are changing by the moment. This app hasn't updated since I downloaded it early last week making this app pointless and not relevant. It's very scary this is the best the CDC can do with an app for the public.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 13:50:08__

> Data is NOT kept current !<br> :date: __2020-03-29 01:11:33__

> The CDC is nothing but uneducated garbage!! You need to employ someone who actually has some common sense to not speak before they have the facts. Great job creating mass hysteria!!!! Well done coming with recommended activities and wearing of masks after the fact.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 06:19:56__

> Political. Nothing more to say.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 23:37:56__

> App won't close no matter what. Have to restart my phone to get out of it. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 23:38:29__

> I'm getting notifications at 2 am....stop<br> :date: __2020-05-02 08:24:32__

> Weaponised propaganda<br> :date: __2020-05-01 14:21:15__

> This app is a joke! Major virus outbreak and it sends no notifications at all, despite being asked for notification information. The CDC needs to get a new developer.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:19:01__

> Uninstalled. Searched high and low for Covid19 stats and located every disease known to man in the dropdown EXCEPT for Covid19. Infornation overload on diseases no one cares about. What about Covid19???<br> :date: __2020-04-26 17:16:17__
