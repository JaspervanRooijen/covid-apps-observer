### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Rhode Island |
| **Website**  | [https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid](https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid) |
| **Email** | CrushCovid.Survey@health.ri.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> Resident of Rhode Island<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:39:10__

> if you don't see the icon, it's not tracking you.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 23:43:54__

> Happy with it, but wish it had: - lower battery drain - visual display of location tracing Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-06-08 19:14:53__

> This should be integrated with the exposure notification system from Apple and Google. Without it, this app exists in its own tiny silo and won't be successful.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 05:33:30__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Update: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 01:24:33__

> Cannot get contact tracing in Crush Colvid<br> :date: __2020-08-10 20:35:33__

> Not totally accurate<br> :date: __2020-07-16 21:44:22__

> Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:41:15__

> James Wadsworth I have found the tracking to be only 75 per cent accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 06:40:02__

> I mean, I get that the app is trying it's best, but it only works in Rhode island! The better news is that at least it warns u what states the coronavirus are tracked<br> :date: __2020-07-11 03:50:12__

> Not accurate or up to date. Last night, I grabbed some takeout and then drove to a park by the ocean to eat it. App says I spent almost two hours at Game Stop (the restaurant is where Game Stop used to be.....4 years ago....)<br> :date: __2020-07-03 18:29:50__

> Shows me at my neighbor's house instead of mine Number of hours shown in day for locations add to more or less than 24<br> :date: __2020-06-27 21:17:46__

> Better, but did not kmow it had to be active on my screen to be working. Needs an option to be a tive in the background.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:26:44__

> Flawed tracking. Please give option to manually add days/locations when there is no tracking history. Just checking location history today and there's been no tracking since the 20th. App has been running and I had expected that it was working.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 04:03:38__

> Had this app for a little while. Always had me in places that ive never been and hardley ever picked up where i actually was. Dont really go to a lot of new places so i tried it but now has been deleted<br> :date: __2020-09-15 14:37:38__

> Shuts down<br> :date: __2020-08-27 14:31:35__

> Battery not working charging likely from multiple ConVid19 tracker, in DC and other areas people may be running different apps from other states like Virginia and miss encounters...<br> :date: __2020-08-24 10:03:37__

> Location tracker doesn't work<br> :date: __2020-08-19 17:52:53__

> Location has never worked even though all settings and permissions have been done. My phone with Google maps me correctly on the few occasions I went out, so I know the phone functions work . What is the problem with this?<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:09:30__

> The location is not accurate most of the time. And everytime I try to submit how I feel today, I get an error. I wish it would let you edit the location<br> :date: __2020-08-06 13:28:54__

> Doesnt work. Keeps saying I'm not connected to the internet. Data and location settings are correct.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:42:15__

> Warning! At least on Android phone, you must manually restart the app after restarting your phone.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 00:05:59__

> I can't even get through the agreement/permissions page. This is my second attempt with this app after the first version was sending alerts and push messages non stop. I guess for every minute I am frustrated trying to use the app, that is a minute that I am less likely to be exposed to Covid.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 13:34:26__

> I finally left app with newest Version 2.1. As Android user the new update has changed app for the worse. You can't send info as it just keeps saying u have to fill out info you have already done...and the location tracker is do far off..it has had me listed in Connecticut for hours when I had not left my house in RI.. Until u fix the bugs...I won't use the app. It started off good... programmers...please don't make the users your Beta group! You should have noticed these bugs if u tested!<br> :date: __2020-09-16 20:47:27__

> Refuses to open after recent update. Removed and reinstalled and still fails<br> :date: __2020-09-11 15:49:03__

> This app still doesn't accurately keep track of my location 😒! I did everything suggested to assist it that was given as "tips" and it's not right 95% of the time! I always have my phone on and use either data or wi-fi. The only location that it gets correct sometimes is home. If it doesn't get fixed I might as well uninstall it.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 17:37:19__

> If it can't track my location, then what good is it? It's good for nothing. I don't need this app taking up space on my phone if it doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-08-19 20:05:36__
