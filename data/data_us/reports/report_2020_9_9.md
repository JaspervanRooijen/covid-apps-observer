## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |
| **Email** | tim.brookins@proudcrowd.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name.

I have yet to see anything on my page of anywhere that I've been tracked it just keeps saying congratulations you are set up but doesn't detect that you win any places yet. I don't go very often but I have went to stores and I have spent more than 10 minutes there why can't I see where I have been?<br> :date: __2020-06-01 23:56:11__

> I wish this used the exposure API rather than log GPS coordinates. As I understand, the exposure API is just a log of device identifiers of other nearby phones, stored locally, rotated every 2 weeks. Your phone then simply downloads identifiers of any recent positives in your area and alerts you if they match any your phone has been near. That's very minimal impact on me and a health organization. For me, you don't know that I went to the eye doctor on Tuesday. For you: the health dept doesn't then have to go around in hazmat suits trying to play investigator - nor posting some public notice "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS WOMAN AT THE EYE DOCTOR ON TUESDAY? IF SO, YOU MAY BE INFECTED." One is a little more subtle message, cleans up after itself, puts the burden of response to the user, likely more reliable against device power savings features, and more battery friendly where a GPS/cell tower solution is more invasive, doesn't really capture proximity to another device, probably gets affected by device power savings features, elicits more work and exposes too much to a 3rd party. I'd just scrap this one and make an open source solution using the exposure API.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 20:08:29__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |
| **Website**  | [http://www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov) |
| **Email** | CDCMobileDevelopment@cdc.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

> Very easy to use and I like that it makes it easier to do contact tracing if I get sick. If I miss the Governor's press conference while I'm at work all I have to do is just go on the app and I'm up to date.<br> :date: __2020-06-10 00:54:57__

> more f<br> :date: __2020-08-06 01:07:34__

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> Resident of Rhode Island<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:39:10__

> if you don't see the icon, it's not tracking you.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 23:43:54__

> Happy with it, but wish it had: - lower battery drain - visual display of location tracing Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-06-08 19:14:53__

> Cannot get contact tracing in Crush Colvid<br> :date: __2020-08-10 20:35:33__

> Not totally accurate<br> :date: __2020-07-16 21:44:22__

> Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:41:15__

> James Wadsworth I have found the tracking to be only 75 per cent accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 06:40:02__

> I mean, I get that the app is trying it's best, but it only works in Rhode island! The better news is that at least it warns u what states the coronavirus are tracked<br> :date: __2020-07-11 03:50:12__

> Not accurate or up to date. Last night, I grabbed some takeout and then drove to a park by the ocean to eat it. App says I spent almost two hours at Game Stop (the restaurant is where Game Stop used to be.....4 years ago....)<br> :date: __2020-07-03 18:29:50__

> Shows me at my neighbor's house instead of mine Number of hours shown in day for locations add to more or less than 24<br> :date: __2020-06-27 21:17:46__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Uodate: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing g shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-06-27 15:30:01__

> Better, but did not kmow it had to be active on my screen to be working. Needs an option to be a tive in the background.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:26:44__

> Shuts down<br> :date: __2020-08-27 14:31:35__

> Battery not working charging likely from multiple ConVid19 tracker, in DC and other areas people may be running different apps from other states like Virginia and miss encounters...<br> :date: __2020-08-24 10:03:37__

> Location tracker doesn't work<br> :date: __2020-08-19 17:52:53__

> Location has never worked even though all settings and permissions have been done. My phone with Google maps me correctly on the few occasions I went out, so I know the phone functions work . What is the problem with this?<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:09:30__

> The location is not accurate most of the time. And everytime I try to submit how I feel today, I get an error. I wish it would let you edit the location<br> :date: __2020-08-06 13:28:54__

> Doesnt work. Keeps saying I'm not connected to the internet. Data and location settings are correct.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:42:15__

> Warning! At least on Android phone, you must manually restart the app after restarting your phone.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 00:05:59__

> Location is way off, not accurate at all<br> :date: __2020-07-18 14:39:33__

> I am rooting for this app. But there are several problems: 1) I can't access the new version on my Android phone, the "Let's go" button doesn't seem to work when trying to boot up the app the first time. 2) I wish it would just keep itself running and send my info continuously, once I have given it permission (I often forget to log in and then it stops sending updates). I know it's trying to respect privacy, but there should be an option for those who don't mind to just let it do it's thing.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 21:26:13__

> Gave version 2.0 a try. Went to a Warwick restaurant for 1.5 hours. There is no record of this in "My Location Diary". I really wanted this version to work. I don't understand how the basic and essential functionality doesn't work properly.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 01:38:57__

> This sucks as$ it doesn't work<br> :date: __2020-09-07 03:10:12__

> Location tracking was working, now it's not.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 16:46:30__

> This app still doesn't accurately keep track of my location 😒! I did everything suggested to assist it that was given as "tips" and it's not right 95% of the time! I always have my phone on and use either data or wi-fi. The only location that it gets correct sometimes is home. If it doesn't get fixed I might as well uninstall it.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 17:37:19__

> If it can't track my location, then what good is it? It's good for nothing. I don't need this app taking up space on my phone if it doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-08-19 20:05:36__

> PLEASE REFACTOR LOCATION TRACKING! Perhaps the sensing approach met privacy goals, battery drain etc., but it's not delivering and some courage is needed (leadership) to face the reality and use or license someone else's proven working tracing approach. (And having to load app manually and keep in a foreground process all the time is plain daffy! When I happen to remember and do it, the location data it gathers is more wrong than right...)<br> :date: __2020-08-16 17:20:13__

> Racist fear mongering app<br> :date: __2020-08-08 17:43:15__

> Didnt work<br> :date: __2020-08-06 19:57:23__

> Not recording anything<br> :date: __2020-07-26 22:25:27__

> Useless and intrusive. A secret way for Ramondo (D) to spy on her constituents and keep them in line. BIG BROTHER/SISTER!!!<br> :date: __2020-07-21 13:45:19__

> I have an LG Aristo 2 Plus. App worked great for 1 month. Then it stopped working. When I hit Send after putting in my zip code, it reads:. "Cannot submit data. Please try again.". I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times. Contacted T Mobile. They checked my phone and say it was the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 22:55:42__
