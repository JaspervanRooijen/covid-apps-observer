# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |
| **Email** | tim.brookins@proudcrowd.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Simple app. Does what it was designed for but little else. Misses many locations and frequently has location accuracy issues. Routinely misses my home by 6 blocks.

> Not very accurate for locations. It does not show several places my wife & I have been for an hour or more and it shows us stopping at places we only drove passed on our way to our destination that does not show up. Very inaccurate. It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name. It's pointless/useless for tracking when this inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-06-05 01:20:41__

> I have a samsung android phone and I used the app Tacoma 19 South Dakota app from Google Play. I have installed it and reinstalled it this install that reinstalled it and updated it every time. I have yet to see anything on my page of anywhere that I've been tracked it just keeps saying congratulations you are set up but doesn't detect that you win any places yet. I don't go very often but I have went to stores and I have spent more than 10 minutes there why can't I see where I have been?<br> :date: __2020-06-01 23:56:11__

> I wish this used the exposure API rather than log GPS coordinates. As I understand, the exposure API is just a log of device identifiers of other nearby phones, stored locally, rotated every 2 weeks. Your phone then simply downloads identifiers of any recent positives in your area and alerts you if they match any your phone has been near. That's very minimal impact on me and a health organization. For me, you don't know that I went to the eye doctor on Tuesday. For you: the health dept doesn't then have to go around in hazmat suits trying to play investigator - nor posting some public notice "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS WOMAN AT THE EYE DOCTOR ON TUESDAY? IF SO, YOU MAY BE INFECTED." One is a little more subtle message, cleans up after itself, puts the burden of response to the user, likely more reliable against device power savings features, and more battery friendly where a GPS/cell tower solution is more invasive, doesn't really capture proximity to another device, probably gets affected by device power savings features, elicits more work and exposes too much to a 3rd party. I'd just scrap this one and make an open source solution using the exposure API.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 20:08:29__

> Hasn't loaded anything in 3 days not impressed.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 14:57:46__

> This app would make sense if it correctly tracked where you were. It needs an update to better track it also for walking. Poor and elderly won't use this nor will people who refuse so information will be limited. Needs an upgrade to let you know if you've been around someone with Coronavirus. Good idea but needs fixing<br> :date: __2020-05-21 05:24:02__

> This app does not record all the places I've been. I was in 5 different businesses in one day for more than 15 minutes and it did not record them . This app has a few bugs...I write down mow.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 22:58:49__

> Does not work in NJ<br> :date: __2020-05-18 02:41:29__

> I work in Technology Sales, Retail. So I wanted an app that would start tracking my locations AUTOMATICALLY to assist me in providing that data needed for my Contact Tracers should the need arise. This app FAILS MISERABLY!!! It DOES NOT track when I am some place for more than an hour. Examples: Work, Gym, Restaurants. Don't waste your time on the Android version of this app!!! Look elsewhere. Samsung S20+ 5G<br> :date: __2020-06-27 04:18:00__

> Location is in issue for me<br> :date: __2020-06-25 00:03:09__

> I saw the update that you could manually put in where you have been by the developer in 5/20. They said it would be implemented within the next update. However, it has now been over a month & time is of the essence. A month long wait for a feature that is now allowing a significant amount of people to use the app or provide inaccurate data is unacceptable. Please fix this asap or please ND & SD find a new developer. As a programmer, the basic first step before release is bug testing.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 11:19:38__

> This has not updated my location since 5/12. It is now the 14th. It's missing about 50% of where I've been. You should have the ability to enter information manually or name places if it's not recording your location. If everyone has this poor of a tracking record, it's pretty usless. Update June 5th.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app which provides Rhode Islanders easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, including a location diary that helps users identify the people and places they are in contact with and a symptom checking survey.
<br>Thank you for using the CRUSH COVID RI app and taking an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island. You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.

> Very easy to use and I like that it makes it easier to do contact tracing if I get sick. If I miss the Governor's press conference while I'm at work all I have to do is just go on the app and I'm up to date.<br> :date: __2020-06-10 00:54:57__

> Love it but would like to see an area you can write who you hsve been with besides in a seperate notebook<br> :date: __2020-06-09 02:03:46__

> Eats to much battery<br> :date: __2020-05-27 18:23:52__

> Thanks for help<br> :date: __2020-05-23 17:24:32__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 22:02:18__

> Happy with it, but wish it had: - lower battery drain - visual display of location tracing Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-06-08 19:14:53__

> In principle it's great. The developer need to patch a few things, though. Also, it doesn't do passive tracking so either the app is open and running or it won't do anything<br> :date: __2020-06-04 14:38:07__

> Excellent resource for Covid-19 info along with optional tracking feature to assist with contact tracing. Version 1.0 has some room for improvement, but it is an excellent tool to assist the DOH with their mission of protecting the health of RI citizens. I feel like I am helping to do my part in a small way by downloading this app.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 01:20:55__

> Took (me) some extra effort to find the app but it was Soo easy to download it once I finally found it. Very simple to use and I feel Very safe about my privacy control. GJGR!<br> :date: __2020-05-24 10:19:46__

> Does what its supposed to however I can only set it to detect location when app is in use. There's no way that I've found to set it all the time.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 04:56:47__

> So far, so good. One stop area for compilation of data and information.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 03:37:50__

> Decent app. The gps seems to slingshot. Of it shows me going out in my neighborhood when i was home.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 00:15:21__

> Great idea RI DOH<br> :date: __2020-05-19 21:24:30__

> First to download hope it works<br> :date: __2020-05-19 19:10:52__

> Shows me at my neighbor's house instead of mine Number of hours shown in day for locations add to more or less than 24<br> :date: __2020-06-27 21:17:46__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Uodate: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing g shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-06-27 15:30:01__

> Better, but did not kmow it had to be active on my screen to be working. Needs an option to be a tive in the background.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:26:44__

> Connect to sarahlandry coronavirous<br> :date: __2020-06-11 01:25:17__

> Not ready for prime time. "Location Diary" only shows my current location. "Settings" supposedly contains the option to modify location settings. It does not.<br> :date: __2020-06-10 23:13:13__

> Meaningless precision and poor accuracy. Maybe new version is better.<br> :date: __2020-06-09 11:00:28__

> Easy install. All you need is to enable gps permissions. Location data is saved on the phone and you can review the locations you went to. I found you can turn off the tracking in the settings by pulling down the menu, swiping left on the crush covid icon, and clicking the cog icon. Then toggle the button to disable. There needs to be a way to turn on and off easier from the top pull down menu. This will allow users to turn off when at home to save battery.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 14:44:12__

> Tracker does not update correctly.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 11:23:20__

> App has helpful information but the My Location Diary has been inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-05-25 17:18:49__

> Started off well but crushed my battery and has been causing issues with my GPS using apps. Can't have it on all the time which kind of defeats the point.<br> :date: __2020-05-24 17:43:32__

> I had the app when it first came out and it worked fine until 3 weeks ago then it stopped tracking me. I just got a new Note 10 and it won't let me finish setting it up . Won't respond on last page of setup to allow it to track, etc. So I uninstalled it and am going to try to install it again<br> :date: __2020-06-19 20:44:25__

> Not accurate. Uses too much battery.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 01:11:30__

> On my Google Pixel 3 Android, the app only gives me the options to access location while using the app or to deny location services. There is no option for allow all the time. Thus, my location diary has nothing in it! Also, an excellent feature for this app would be a contact diary.<br> :date: __2020-06-09 03:10:53__

> Not accurate. My husband and I both downloaded and it hasn't been even close to accurate. He likes golf but didn't spend 30 hours there the other day. Maybe this new version will be better. It's a good idea.<br> :date: __2020-06-09 02:04:04__

> I noticed that my location has me at the wrong places and On other times it doesn't show where I went over the 10 minutes....<br> :date: __2020-06-08 22:32:43__

> Good idea bleh execution app is barren amd pins do not stick. Develop moar<br> :date: __2020-06-04 03:55:32__

> Doesn't recognize as data on or connected to wifi.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 20:55:20__

> Not accurate. Looking at my history it has me at places I've never even been close too!<br> :date: __2020-05-31 00:28:14__

> Killed my battery quickly. Makes sense but google maps does the same tracking of where I go.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 22:35:54__

> Location does not work all the time, only if app is running, so it useless, as I can't seem to set it to access location all the time? So the location data is not updating.<br> :date: __2020-05-25 18:06:42__

> Mmm<br> :date: __2020-06-26 05:59:51__

> The app completely missed my morning hike, seems to work only intermittently.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 04:36:49__

> "My location diary" doesn't do anything. It doesn't show where I have been. Don't throw away your log book. This is worthless.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 21:20:44__

> I dont think I spent 125 hours in one day at a location very inaccurate and may skip a few days and hours<br> :date: __2020-06-25 20:51:58__

> It is incredibly inaccurate. I live in Cranston. We went to the border of CT and got off the motorcycle for over 30 minutes. It didn't record my location at all that day. Now it's reading I was at Ace Hardware for HOURS. I wasn't there at all. Worthless. UPDATE - MY LOCATION DIARY HAS NOT UPDATED IN 10 DAYS. REMOVING THIS FROM MY PHONE.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 05:34:38__

> Thus app is not working on my android smart phone. No locations are being recorded.<br> :date: __2020-06-24 19:24:21__

> Completely inaccurate. This is the wrong solution. Should use Google COVID-19 Proximity Tracking API, which already works. But app relies on ineffective method that (sometimes) stores your (wong) location history locally and then flags you as a contact if RIDOH parameters have been met. So you still have to rely on people correlating information and calling you. Way too many variables will mean very slow, and never complete, adiption. Don't reinvent the wheel.<br> :date: __2020-06-24 05:16:21__

> Remove covid19<br> :date: __2020-06-22 06:32:14__

> F\*\** off big brother<br> :date: __2020-06-19 16:58:23__

> Download the app and select language preference but can't proceed from that point.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 14:30:46__
