## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
