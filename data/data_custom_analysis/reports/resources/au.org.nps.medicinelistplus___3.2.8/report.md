## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm 73 and find this app great for meds reminders<br> :date: __2020-02-14 09:57:04__

> Neat app to organise your medications. You can also enter you blood pressure, sugar readings and generate a useful report for that. Well done NPS, I will certainly recommend it for my patients.<br> :date: __2019-12-26 09:15:47__

> It's great - As a Hospital Pharmacist I will happily recommend it to patients üòÉ<br> :date: __2019-12-03 22:36:47__

> Had some problems with the update but these have resolved. It's actually now better than before. I can now email my medicines list without the header of the second page over writing the list at that point. Anyway, this is definitely the best app to keep all of your medicines together for when you need it.<br> :date: __2019-07-05 00:10:02__

> very good app<br> :date: __2019-06-25 09:18:36__

> I use this app to keep track of and give accurate information on my many medications. Also great for when I attend hospital & specialists when they need to know all my meds & dosage. Great functional app.<br> :date: __2019-06-25 01:45:56__

> Hi Guys, thanks for your great product. Is there any chance of a no sign in option? Sign in bug again after every update.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 00:01:12__

> Only a limited number of medicines found by scanning, but all were found by name search. No ability that i could see to print out the list which would be useful to carry in a wallet or purse. Entering date of birth seemed very tedious but the developer responded and explained the best way to get back to the year of birth which made it easy. Good response from the developer. Added a star!<br> :date: __2020-06-06 02:36:22__

> Can't print or save details to give to my doctors.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 09:33:59__

> Good once ypu get used to it have been using for about 5 years<br> :date: __2019-09-10 04:21:34__

> Cannot add daily quantities of medication. Keeps blocking any quantities entered.Even the default is added as above. It defaults back to zero.Tapping the entry does nothing.<br> :date: __2019-07-15 14:38:38__

> a very handy appI'll<br> :date: __2019-06-26 10:32:47__

> Good app, have resolved daylight saving issue, but could you please add Noonan Syndrome to the list of health conditions?<br> :date: __2019-04-13 11:15:01__

> Makes listing medications so much easier at a new doctor or hospital addmissions<br> :date: __2018-12-06 05:55:33__

> Good app but every time I try to add one of my medications it crashes. Just this one medication. The others added fine.<br> :date: __2018-04-08 00:03:04__

> I had previously deleted this app because of login problems and ongoing issues with locking up. I have now reinstalled the app (Feb 2018) and created a new account. Seems to be working OK. Still don't know what version I'm  running!<br> :date: __2018-02-16 12:48:51__

> Was working perfectly until a couple of months ago. Now logs me out and will not recognise my login. Have to uninstall, reinstall. Happens every 2-3 days.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 00:15:29__

> A borderline app in my opinion. Just enough features to make it useful, almost enough faults to make me uninstall. The app tries to do it all and with this objective limits user control . I don't want reminders but it's more complex than it needs to be to change them. Can't easily add or delete menu items. I use more than one device but apparently the app won't allow two devices to log in simultaneously but there's no warning of this. App is ok, but could be much better<br> :date: __2020-08-01 08:46:40__

> Continuously displays the 'spinning circle' when trying to e-mail medicine list or syncing with good wifi network/4G connection. Never times out and rarely e-mails or syncs. Have persisted for some years but doesn't really improve in these network issues. 12JUL2020: Reverting to v3.2.3 (2 updates back) allows the network connections/e-mail to work.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 13:48:37__

> It would be a helpful app however I wish the reminders could actually be set to make a sound/alarm. I cannot seem to find such option. I am not always looking at my phone or have it nearby to SEE a reminder.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 12:20:01__

> This app seemed great at the start offering helpful things like blood pressure reports etc. its now very frustrating. When trying to generate a report it goes into thinking mode and nothing happens. IT then asked me to log back in and when I did all medication data had gone. This app promises the world but doesn't deliver ‚òπÔ∏è<br> :date: __2019-07-16 08:06:14__

> Interesting changes, frustrated that you now have to enter password every time you log in.<br> :date: __2019-06-25 10:24:47__

> very helpful when going to hospital or new doctor.<br> :date: __2019-06-25 08:11:37__

> Generally useful but it would be handy to be able to put in recurring appointments and also record health events such as scans and blood tests. My wife has just started chemo for pancreatic cancer and there are a lot of appointments and tests to remember. I guess it is primarily there for medicines - which it does well, but being able to put start and finish dates on the schedules that set the reminders accordingly would help a lot.<br> :date: __2019-01-02 02:36:43__

> I am not always getting the reminders to take medication. And I am looking for a way to know what time I took a PRN medication and when it is next due, I do not take PRN meds at the same time every day, for it depends on when I need them.<br> :date: __2018-12-29 23:56:19__

> I got this app so that I would get reminders for my meds, but the reminder apparently does not work for the Samsung Galaxy S7! Is this able to be fixed, if not I will need to look for an app that will give reminders. Cheers<br> :date: __2018-11-19 00:53:07__

> No medicines found by scanning but ok inputting manually. Only shows 4 of my medicines instead of 8. How do I view the rest.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 15:55:41__

> Does not even barcodes from any of my medicines requires a postcode for Australia when I am itinerant and officially don't have one! Two glaring problems that make me think little research was done!<br> :date: __2020-04-16 01:57:41__

> I can't access data. Had password reset still can't get in<br> :date: __2019-11-27 00:08:26__

> Good concept, but buggy execution.<br> :date: __2019-05-05 00:48:18__

> the app has great features and can add plenty of information, but no matter what I try I can't get it to give me a notification or reminder for when to take my tablets. I tried turning the reminders off and on, and I checked all the permissions but still can't figure it out.<br> :date: __2019-04-30 23:04:52__

> while this app is good, theres nowhere for me to view a history of the meds taken or when. rather i need to generate and email a report which is a bit pointless if i just want to see it onscreen.. also the medicine start and end dates dont bring up a calendar, rather is a text baded field?????<br> :date: __2019-01-04 12:38:27__

> Was great to start with but if you add more than one or two people it becomes slow and lags. Also time out length is to short.<br> :date: __2018-10-05 06:10:43__

> The app won't email my medication list.<br> :date: __2018-07-28 06:48:03__

> Good digital record of medications.. great for visit to new 
doctor/hospital. Would love a proper diary function for past history. Would 
love to be able to sort by date and subject. I use Notes for this purpose 
but unwieldy doesn't work too well<br> :date: __2018-05-13 10:40:38__

> Frequently signs you out (appears to be after each update). So notifications stop, then I personally forget to take any meds for a couple of days because I don't realise. Going to find another strategy.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 02:49:33__

> I missed my dose 3 times, keeps logging out automatically when med is once a week. Useless.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 01:44:15__

> useless application, a good idea, that has been terribly executed. IMHO a waste of tax payers money. All my medications couldn't be added because it didnt recognise the barcodes. Adding family members doesnt mean they get access to the same info. adding statistics and test results doesnt allow you to see trends oe ar historical information.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 13:09:00__

> Pretty lousy the app could not find at least one medication out of 13 that I scanned. Was unable to fill out field for reasons for taking medication. Too much friggin around with this. No thanks, I can put all info on my profile on the phone easy enough. Uninstall this one I think.<br> :date: __2020-07-18 23:57:48__

> OMG this app is sooooooo stupid i tried setting the up and gave up and uninstalled the app. usless as<br> :date: __2020-04-17 09:35:41__

> Useless. All it does is crash repeatedly<br> :date: __2019-10-18 05:52:36__

> App requested to sign up. Great. Asked to set PIN for security. Open the app, enter correct PIN then it asks to sign in again. Over the top security requirements.<br> :date: __2019-07-30 01:09:38__
