### Description
> Babylon is a health app that gives you access to exclusive health tools like Healthcheck and Chatbot Symptom Checker.
<br>And, if you use Babylon through your healthcare provider, you can even speak to a doctor or nurse practitioner through select health plans. 
<br>----------------------------
<br>Don’t have access through your health plan? You can still get access to our Chatbot symptom checker and Healthcheck for general health care tips and health information about your symptoms.
<br>CHATBOT SYMPTOM CHECKER
<br>Describe your symptoms the same way you would to a doctor or nurse practitioner, and the Chabot will ask questions related to your symptoms and health, so it can help you decide what to do next. 
<br>It can recognize most issues that primary care providers tend to see. 
<br>HEALTHCHECK
<br>Healthcheck was created by doctors and scientists to help you understand your current and future health needs.
<br>Here’s how it works: 
<br>Answer questions about your lifestyle and family history to generate a wellness report and build a Digital Twin to explore your body from the inside out.
<br>Get insights about your current health and risk factors for future conditions, along with recommendations for staying healthy long-term.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Having issues lately.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 23:54:21__

> Its a nice app, and I used to use it on Samsung Health. I will say though that there is a problem in the middle section, the healthcheck. I filled out the questions asked of me but when I went to go click on thr diagram of "my body" the app crashes every time and never allows me to click on the anatomical structures.<br> :date: __2020-01-06 14:42:19__

> I can't trust this, at least not yet. I've run the chatbot through symptoms I know are associated with conditions that a doctor has diagnosed, and it's missed the mark 10 times out of 10. It REALLY wants me to have cancer. Sore throat? Cancer. Itchy anus? Cancer. Sore shoulder? Cancer. OK, maybe I am exaggerating, but only a little! It does have a lot of potential, but it's just not ready to be trusted with a true unknown ailment yet.<br> :date: __2019-11-04 18:54:30__

I then called for the 2nd time requesting an appt in the evening and was told the latest appt was 1230... all advertisement says appt as late as 7 pm. Asked if I could book for Nov bc all late appts were already booked but they don't do appointments until last week of Oct for nov. Was previously told that for oct but when called all evening appts were booked. This company is a joke!<br> :date: __2020-09-30 02:36:00__

> My insurance RENEWS in 2 weeks, yet this app says my coverage doesn't start until 2 weeks. BS. Can't make an appointment I need now.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 04:02:33__

> Tried to make appt, none available for a week, and no option to book further out. Useless.<br> :date: __2020-09-06 05:01:10__

> Sucks all I want to do is set up appts but it's doing everything but that too many questions and it freezes smh cant even answer the question below cant see choices GARBAGE waist of my time<br> :date: __2020-09-04 10:50:12__
