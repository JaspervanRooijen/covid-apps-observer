### Description
> The Videoinsight® Method by Rebecca Russo is a support for Physical and
<br>Psychological Well-being. It is a psychological enhancing method that 
<br>involves the vision of contemporary Art Videos, selected according to their 
<br>content and transformative potential, with the intent to catalyze 
<br>the Videoinsight® psychological experience and to facilitate the process that 
<br>allows the individual to stimulate sensations, emotions, learning, psycho-
<br>aptitude orientation, actions and changes. Videoinsight® means the capacity 
<br>to understand the interior psychic pathway and consequently to allow 
<br>therapeutic transformation. It is a simple and essential intuition, a discovery, 
<br>an awareness that involves mind and emotions at conscious and 
<br>unconscious levels.
<br>Videoinsight® Art for Care by Videoinsight® Foundation is an innovative and 
<br>interactive Art exhibition aimed to support, prevent and promote Body and 
<br>Mind Well-being. Spectators are invited to relate in a deep and dynamic way 
<br>with selected Art Videos from Videoinsight® Collection with High 
<br>Videoinsight®  Impact .Videoinsight® Art for Care Videos contain a significant 
<br>psycho-diagnostic and psycho-therapeutic meaning. They can help to treat 
<br>the psychological and psychosomatic discomfort after a mental or corporal 
<br>stress, increasing the resistance capacity and improving the cognitive and 
<br>behavioural power, offering new solutions, improving the orientation of 
<br>attitudes and talents for evolution.  
<br>The Videoinsight® Method has been verified in the clinical, psychological and 
<br>medical setting. The Videoinsight® Method integrates Culture and Health in a 
<br>novel, holistic and interdisciplinary way. Its efficacy has been demonstrated 
<br>through objective Medical studies and recognized by the international 
<br>scientific community.  Videoinsight® Art Videos are selected with 
<br>competence, responsibility and professional ethics on the basis of the 
<br>psychological needs of the viewer. They immediately engage mind and heart, 
<br>break defences of intellectual judgment, stimulate narrative interpretation, 
<br>activate insights by pressing on the personalities potentials. The ability to 
<br>select the appropriate videos is the result of several years of research carried 
<br>out on the basis of a specific and integrated skill in the psycho-therapeutic 
<br>and artistic fields.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Ice Cream Sandwich, version 4.0.1 - 4.0.2 (API level 14) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
