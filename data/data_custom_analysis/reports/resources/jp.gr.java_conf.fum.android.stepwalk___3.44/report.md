### Description
> StepWalk is an app loaded with handy features for walking such as a pedometer. By walking with your device, it records the number of steps you've taken and your location information. 
<br>Details of the app's features are as follows: 
<br>●Pedometer
<br>Counts the number of steps you've taken and displays time, distance and calories. 
<br>To avoid counting unwanted steps, it will start recording from the 10th step. (But not when in sleep mode.)
<br>By turning off "COUNT" on the main screen, you can turn off the pedometer. 
<br>※ As the retrieval of location information operates simultaneously with the pedometer, when "COUNT" is turned off, "LOCATION" will also be turned off. 
<br>●Graph
<br>The Day・Week・Month・Year・Rank of the recorded number of steps will be displayed as a graph. ("Rank" displays the top 50 days in recorded steps.)
<br>By selecting "Display calorie" on the graph screen menu, you can also see the calorie graph. 
<br>You can adjust stride and weight of specific dates in "Day".
<br>●Map
<br>Displays the recorded walking route.
<br>If location information is acquired by GPS, "footprints" will be displayed. If location information is acquired only by the network, "pin" will be displayed.
<br>When you tap the info window or long press the map, it displays the Street View.
<br>By turning off "LOCATION" on the main screen, you can turn off location retrieval.
<br>※ Turning on / off the GPS and network is device setting.
<br>○ Time Selection
<br>By selecting the target time, the approximate location at that time will be displayed on the map as a "miniature bulb". 
<br>○ View Photos 
<br>Any photos taken during the day will be displayed at the bottom. 
<br>Selecting the photo (setting it in the center by swiping) will display the approximate location where the photo was taken on the map with a "treasure chest". 
<br>Tap on the photo to enlarge it. 
<br>○Location Info Email
<br>You can send location information via mailer or SMS app. Its location can be changed.
<br>Google Maps URL link is inserted in the body, and the recipient can check its location on Google Maps (app or web).
<br>●Settings
<br>Set stride, weight, pedometer sensitivity, location accuracy (GPS, network) and dark mode.
<br>By default, the dark mode change screens according to the dark theme on Android 10 and later devices.
<br>In the settings, you can select either light or dark mode.
<br>Map dark mode can be changed individually on the map settings screen.
<br>●Backup And Restore
<br>You can backup and restore data from the main menu. 
<br>For more details, please refer to the help section in the app menu. ("?" icon)
<br>*** Note ***
<br>● Display the screen once after the installation. 
<br>※ Task killer apps will force quit apps operating in the background. Using these apps will prevent accurate counting. 
<br>※Android 4.4.2 has issue that background apps are not restarted.
<br>　https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=63793
<br>※Android 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 has issue that background apps are killed.
<br>　https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79729
<br>● Positioning by GPS alone will consume power. 
<br>We do our best to reduce power consumption, but the amount of consumption will depend on the GPS receiver in your device.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> After calibration it is quite accurate,easy to use.map and statistic are really helpful./i have been using it for 5 years and i tried all free ones in google play ,and decided this is perfect fit for me ,more than enough.if it doesnt count correctly change the sensivity (calibrate)and walk 200steps and check again mine ~%1 .generally medium sensivity is ok.<br> :date: __2019-07-11 15:08:47__

> Used this for 4 years. Tried others which but this is the best for me. Judt works. Settings are easy.<br> :date: __2019-07-05 15:51:09__

> This is a great step counter! Even shows you where you've been. The sensitivity adjustment is nice.<br> :date: __2019-06-14 02:32:43__

> I like this app but recently I have been finding that after a walk, it was not on. Why is this? Previously it was always keeping track of my movements.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 23:07:27__

> Awesome app. Guys download this app should u want to know how far have you walked, how much energy have you spent and how many steps have you stepped on to reach a distance in a day. Interestingly, you would even know the place(s) that you've gone to on that day. Even more interesting...... you would know what snap(s) have you snapped on that day and in that place. It runs in the background. You don't have to open it often. Only once; enough. It works offline. But UI,... it's a bit not nice.<br> :date: __2020-03-21 03:03:20__

> very practical.<br> :date: __2019-07-12 00:44:55__

> Very helpful<br> :date: __2019-03-18 09:01:03__

> Works well but has occasional fits of stopping.so turn off phone or reboot ,works well<br> :date: __2018-12-22 15:26:13__

> I was using this app to monitor the distance that I walk and the calories that I burnt. It's seems to be a good app. I recommended this app to monitor your activities. Thanks to this app.<br> :date: __2017-09-05 19:48:54__

> Seems to be working OK. Better than the others I have tried on my Moto e. Pretty accurate too. Good to see map afterwards. Overall an OK app.<br> :date: __2017-06-07 11:49:26__

> Does drain the battery a bit but it is excellent for keeping track of your activity over the months<br> :date: __2017-04-17 11:09:14__

> Just carrying my phone with me as I drive is adding steps to my record.<br> :date: __2016-11-09 07:55:05__

> ok, but map misleading.<br> :date: __2019-08-27 15:53:19__

> Would like to see a graph of average steps per day for every month so I can quickly see trends over the year(s).  Overall it seems mostly accurate when you have the phone in your possession.<br> :date: __2017-03-16 08:19:11__

> Like others say, I have to Uninstall and reinstall regularly because I'll look and see for several days, it just stops counting steps. Very disappointing and annoying. Great when it works.<br> :date: __2016-06-06 18:43:26__

> I have to delete and reinstall frequently because it will stop counting steps completely. Won't recognize movement even if I shake the phone.<br> :date: __2016-05-30 06:35:00__

> It's probably me, but I cant get a lock on the gps  and it was on, and I started walking, and it didn't count steps. I will try to read up on it. It looks like a great app, and I'm sure yhe gps works great in unison with the route. Give me the simple answer, and I might reinstall it<br> :date: __2015-12-23 04:31:27__

> Whatever the last update was for, it didn't fix it...instead, it broke it! It is A LOT more inaccurate than it was before this last update.<br> :date: __2015-06-14 14:50:14__

> I've been using this since December and the last update made it stop working correctly. My last week of walking it doesn't pick up the number of steps, even when I adjusted the sensitivity. Hopefully a future update can make this work again, because of love this app!<br> :date: __2015-06-12 19:18:23__

> Stop working<br> :date: __2015-04-07 19:50:24__

> The app started off working well. I was a little more sensitive than others but worked. The only issue is it froze on me one day and I had to uninstall it.<br> :date: __2015-03-31 01:58:01__

> I'm sure my rating will go up as my understanding improves.  I haven't been able to master "pins."<br> :date: __2014-12-26 17:37:05__

> I don't like that it logs time spent in traffic as steps and logged 27 
steps before I even got out of bed this morning<br> :date: __2018-08-17 07:39:05__

> This was an excellent app. Sadly now "disimproved" by an insistance that location is allowed. Why is Google so keen to know details which are none of their business? Unless location is enabled it is difficult to access the graph. Google please butt out!<br> :date: __2017-04-07 23:25:01__

> Kept running n background drained my battery.<br> :date: __2016-10-05 12:04:32__

> It was working fine but all of a sudden it won't count my steps. My friend's app was counting 20909 mine 1500 tried to reset few times but does not help at all.<br> :date: __2015-05-15 16:27:08__

> Love the paw. However it counts steps while driving unless you remeber to stop it.<br> :date: __2015-03-20 16:55:10__

> Used it for 3 days. Big battery issue but would have sorted that by stopping and starting when needed. However it stopped reading steps so no 2nd chance....... Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2014-12-24 12:20:29__

> So not useful<br> :date: __2014-01-26 15:17:48__
