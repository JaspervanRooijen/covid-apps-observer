### Description
> MyTens is a medical TENS and EMS device designed for temporary pain relief as well as muscle stimulation of healthy muscles to improve and facilitate muscle performance. MyTens electrotherapy device is wireless and connects to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. You control the device via the application.
<br>The BewellConnect MyTens app only works with the BewellConnect MyTens and MyTens Pro devices. Purchase yours at www.bewell-connect.com.
<br>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a noninvasive, drug free method to temporarily relieve pain associated with sore and aching muscles. Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) works by sending electronic pulses to the muscle needing treatment; this causes the muscle to exercise passively. MyTens offers 19 pre-set programs using both TENS and EMS.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
