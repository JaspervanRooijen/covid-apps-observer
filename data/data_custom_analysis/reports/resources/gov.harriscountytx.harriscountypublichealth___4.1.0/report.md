### Description
> Do you love to eat out, but worry about the cleanliness of restaurant kitchens?  Restaurant and other food establishment inspection results are the first service offered on our new APP!  Our health inspectors are sharing their ratings for the nearly 8,000 restaurants and food establishments they inspect in Harris County, Texas, the nationâ€™s third largest county.  The Harris County Public Health Department helps protect and improve the health of more than two million residents living in an area larger than the State of Rhode Island.  Watch for future updates as our new APP expands to include preventative health services, environmental health, mosquito control, animal care/control and emergency preparedness.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
