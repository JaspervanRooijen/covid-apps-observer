### Description
> Finding information about Medicare coverage is easier than ever now. Download the only official U.S. government Medicare app onto your mobile device.
<br>What’s covered helps you understand the health care coverage offered by Original Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance).
<br>Use this federal government app to:
<br>-Answer your Medicare coverage questions
<br>-See information about your costs
<br>-Learn about covered items & services
<br>-See notes & where to get more information
<br>-Browse free preventive services
<br>Original Medicare Items & Services
<br>Find out what your Medicare coverage has to offer like:
<br>- When are mammograms covered?
<br>- Is home health care covered?
<br>- Will Medicare pay for diabetes supplies?
<br>Preventive Health Coverage
<br>Medicare coverage includes preventive services at no cost to you. Preventive services can help keep you healthy by finding health problems early and can keep you from getting certain diseases.
<br>What’s covered will help you answer questions like:
<br>- Will my Medicare benefits cover services to help me stop smoking?
<br>- Can I get a cervical cancer screening?
<br>- How often will my Medicare coverage allow me to get a bone mass measurement?
<br>Ask your doctor or health care provider which preventive services (like screenings, shots, and tests) you need to get.
<br>Part A & Part B Costs
<br>Medicare Part A and Part B cover certain medical services and supplies in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other health care settings.
<br>Part A hospital insurance coverage helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital, inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, home health care, or inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institution. Copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may apply for each service.
<br>Part B medical insurance coverage supports medically necessary doctors’ services, outpatient care, home health services, durable medical equipment, preventive services, and other medical services. Under Original Medicare, if the Part B deductible applies, you must pay all health care costs (up to the Medicare-approved amount) until you meet the yearly Part B deductible. After your deductible is met, Medicare begins to pay its share and you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount of the service, if the doctor or health care provider accepts assignment. There’s no yearly limit for what you pay out-of-pocket.
<br>For some items and services, you must meet eligibility criteria or you may be responsible for paying all costs. Your doctor or health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn’t cover. If this happens, you may have to pay some or all of the costs. Ask questions so you understand why your doctor is recommending certain services and whether Medicare will pay for them.
<br>Use the What’s covered app to answer questions like:
<br>-How much will I pay for prescription drugs included in Medicare Part B coverage?
<br>-Does the Part B deductible apply for cardiac rehab?
<br>-What percentage of the Medicare-approved amount will I need to pay for colorectal cancer screenings?
<br>What’s Not Included
<br>What’s covered doesn’t contain information on Medicare Advantage Plan, other Medicare health plan, or Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) coverage. It doesn’t contain a CPT code search, exact costs on surgeries or procedures, or local coverage decisions.
<br>Medicare Advantage Plans
<br>If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan, you have the same basic health care coverage as people who have Original Medicare, but the rules vary by plan. Some Medicare Advantage Plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover - like vision, hearing, or dental. Check with the plan or search in the App or Google Play Store to see if the plan has a similar mobile application.
<br>This is Medicare’s first official app, and we value your feedback. Please tell us your thoughts by rating What’s covered.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Easy to look up what is covered. Sometimes I am not sure if a certain office visit or procedure is covered by Medicare, this app helps me find out without having to call and wait on hold. Plus they also have phone numbers to contact if you are unable to locate all the information you need.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 17:02:13__

> Very helpful and easy to understand<br> :date: __2020-08-09 03:02:21__

</p>

> My ex<br> :date: __2020-10-16 16:16:24__

> I was able to find part of the Medicare coverage, but it was a guess because it only examined Advantage Plans. Not mine specifically.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 04:33:42__

> If this was useful it would tell you if something is covered,it does not do this,you have to guess by what its NOT saying,snd then its still only a guess,,waste of time<br> :date: __2019-08-31 20:27:01__

> You type one procedure, it gives good information, but then you have to open the app again for another procedure. We should be able to check a number of procedures without reopening the app each time.<br> :date: __2019-08-29 20:06:47__

> I installed it first, then checked reviews....decided not give a chance, just uninstall The life is to short to spend on bad apps. my rules not install any apps rated below 4.2. 3 stars given for effort, promise & responding to everyone<br> :date: __2019-07-13 08:23:35__

> if this is called what's covered, why wouldn't it do what it says it does? most of these reviews are saying it simply does not say what is covered! I could call Medicare and get this info quicker it seems.<br> :date: __2019-07-01 09:14:56__

> nice<br> :date: __2019-06-08 18:11:07__

> Three stars for a good government idea, and for advertising broadly to Seniors. Minus 2 stars for a low search hit rate for my trial.. Maybe broadening the index with more surgery, treatment, and illness terms leading to brief treatment lists will help in future. A hopeful start, at least.<br> :date: __2019-06-05 23:30:43__

> I am 65 & just signed up for Medicare. Before I installed the app, I read the reviews, most of which were dismal. i fully expected to uninstall it after trying it out. After I downloaded & tested it, I note that this is not a source of medical information, like "WebMD". It is a tool limited to briefly describing Medicare Part A&B insurance coverage. The search engine does indeed suck, and needs a lot of improvement, but the topic browser is helpful, if terse, so I will use it for now.<br> :date: __2019-06-05 06:18:22__

> change the heading to Medicare coverage not what's covered<br> :date: __2019-01-30 18:09:54__



#### 2-star reviews

> Can't find basic items using search function. No results for MRI or for specific providers. Need to upgrade the search function.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 21:18:22__

> Cannot find answer for my question<br> :date: __2020-01-25 22:18:14__

> Doesn't cover anything in depth. Doesn't even know many common ailments. Says it covers surgery, but doesn't go into depth about specific surgeries, since we all know they won't cover every sugery.<br> :date: __2019-11-01 17:45:08__

> Not very useful<br> :date: __2019-09-26 19:47:24__

> You must type in an exact match to find the procedure or test. If you do find it, the details given are very limited. I was looking for a "Diabetic eye exam" but it's listed as "Eye exam (Diabetic)" so no hit on the first try. I was looking for which specific tests are included but it doesn't touch on that at all.<br> :date: __2019-08-31 08:07:48__

> I believe this app was released before it was developed to answer the questions described in it's description of what it's supposed to do as any of the searches I tried to get answered came up with "no results". I would have expected at least 1 hit of the 20 or so searches I tried to enter, which I thought were fairly obvious to determine if something was a covered service or not, services I've either had done or about to have done. I don't think this app is ready by a long shot.<br> :date: __2019-08-30 19:24:30__

> The search function needs work. If you go to "Browse All Items" and look in the "M" section for MRI, you cannot find it. However, if you don't go there and simply type MRI in the "Is my item or service covered" it can be found in a Diagnostic Non-Laboratory category. Interestingly, Xrays are in the Browse index but MRIs are not. One other glitch, if you type "Xrays" it can be found, however, if you accidentally type Xrays with a space after it, (Xrays ) it won't be found.<br> :date: __2019-08-30 02:56:07__

> Doesn't give info on enough conditions...<br> :date: __2019-08-29 21:46:46__

> Forget search, it's useless. Go to the INDEX and look for your subject. Only offers main topics, NOT individual procedures. ATTN TECH DEPT... I suggest you just upload the entire Medicare coverage and then install a GOOD search engine like SOLR Apache. Good luck. I'll keep you around to give you a chance to improve, but don't take too long...this is the digital age, and we need this yesterday. 😜<br> :date: __2019-08-29 20:51:10__

> Nice start but not comprehensive.<br> :date: __2019-08-29 18:20:45__

> Dont know how to use<br> :date: __2020-10-13 05:04:19__

> I understood this app would allow me to see my medical records. It doesn't. Its of no use to me.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 14:51:49__

> Like many other reviews the search function is useless unless you know the exact phrase Medicare uses. I have never been able to find if something is covered or not. Unless the search function is greatly improved this is worthless.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 02:19:10__

> Worthless. Typed in cataract and got a message saying to check my spelling.<br> :date: __2020-01-16 17:14:05__

> Can't find any practical information. Ie. Dr. Visit for flu.<br> :date: __2019-11-05 11:44:49__

> Agree with other reviewer that this app may be somewhat premature and in need of further development. I found more listings for "uncovered" items than actual "covered" proceedures. It would seem that listing "uncovered" would be the same as doing work that needs not be done and that anything not listed would not be covered.<br> :date: __2019-09-30 20:47:10__
