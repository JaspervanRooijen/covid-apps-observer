### Description
> What is DREX?
<br>DREX is the Durham Reading and Exploration training. Through regular training and assessment this free app will teach you to compensate for your partial visual loss.
<br>How does DREX work? 
<br>Training can be completed in your own home and at a time that suits you. You do not have to be supervised to complete this training. The app can be accessed by downloading it for free.
<br>DREX Training
<br>The DREX training consists of two parts:
<br>- The reading training requires you to decide whether a word is a real word or a non-word.
<br>- The exploration training presents you with a number of targets and you must find the target that is different from the rest by size, shape or colour.
<br>DREX training is self-adapting and increases in difficulty as you learn. 
<br>DREX Assessment
<br>Whilst undergoing the DREX training you will be assessed at regular intervals. 5 assessments are used:-
<br>1. Visual Field
<br>2. Visual Search
<br>3. Reading
<br>4. Short Term Memory
<br>5. Quality of life
<br>In this way we can learn whether the DREX training is an effective way of teaching you to compensate for your visual loss.
<br>Sharing your data
<br>You can also choose to share your data with your doctor, occupational therapist or clinician. 
<br>In this way, they can track your progress and suggest other ways to maximise your compensation. This service is completely confidential and if you are uncomfortable with sharing your data you can still access the DREX training without this option.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
