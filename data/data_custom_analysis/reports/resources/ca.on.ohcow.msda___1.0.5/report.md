### Description
> Download this useful app that delivers a very basic ergonomic assessment by running through a series of diagrams and questions to pinpoint musculoskeletal pain, identify possible sources, and discover practical solutions - right from your smartphone! The results are depicted on a body map, with recommendations to address work-related MSD hazards that could be contributing to your discomfort.  No personal data is collected, but summary results can be shared with others (at your discretion) in order to report hazards or foster solutions.
<br>While a professional ergonomic assessment is considered the most effective way to address work-related discomfort, this app is a good first step to help you recognize the signs of MSD and take action for prevention. For more information, visit www.ohcow.on.ca/resources or to make an inquiry or discuss a worksite visit, contact us at painpoint@ohcow.ca
<br> 
<br>This app is the result of a valuable and productive professional collaboration: combining the clinical expertise and ergonomic content of the Occupational Health Clinic for Ontario Workers (OHCOW) with the technological knowledge and communication skills of the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety’s (CCOHS), www.ccohs.ca

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Ice Cream Sandwich, version 4.0.1 - 4.0.2 (API level 14) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
