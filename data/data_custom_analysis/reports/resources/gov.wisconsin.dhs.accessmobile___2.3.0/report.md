In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> EASY TO USE<br> :date: __2020-10-18 18:58:51__

> I really like how easy and simple MYACCESS is to use. The one thing that could be better is the app will says there is no more files I need to download to access my badger card food stamps when I did and the account was frozen for a while because of that.<br> :date: __2020-08-19 00:09:09__

> Easy to use and overall, gets the job done. Not always synced with what the person on the phone says, but it does a great job at what it does.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 01:00:57__

> Has made these things so much easier<br> :date: __2020-06-29 20:40:04__

> It is nice and I like it ,but it would be better if it showed our total amount we have left of benefits and maybe some more ways of accessing help in case we need immediately...<br> :date: __2020-06-15 16:44:44__

> Reliable for sure and speedy!! If you ever call down to Milwaukee County and a man answer, I've gotten him a few times, he always wishes me and my family to be safe and stay blessed!

> It would be nice to have a notes section when submitting documents. And I also think a little more useful. I couldn't renew my benefits on the app but it would have been nice to be able to do that.<br> :date: __2020-09-08 16:01:16__

> No way to free text. If documents don't exist, there should be a way of noting it.<br> :date: __2020-08-31 15:32:44__

> Not sure how to uhh<br> :date: __2020-08-31 11:29:22__

> It is very hard to "upload pay check stubs and letters. It does not appear clear at all and the neccessary information looks like ink spothes and are not legible at all. You will have to address this issue or you will have lots of frustrated people.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 23:33:12__

> It's okay. Once approved the options available to upload docs are confusing<br> :date: __2020-07-28 19:44:57__

> We should gave more information out about your case<br> :date: __2020-04-17 00:50:38__

> Easy to install. Intuitive. When using camera to upload documents, you can only upload 2 images at a time or else the app freezes. To upload multiple pages you must exit and log in for every 2 images.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 23:48:27__

> It could be a little bit better<br> :date: __2020-03-29 01:59:49__

> Fast and quick<br> :date: __2020-02-21 04:41:08__

> You cannot access your messages through the app which is quite inconvenient and even though I knew I needed to upload documents it still says that I'm "all set". And it basically just tells you what you are enrolled in, allows you to upload documents but doesn't get provide much of anything else. And It would help if for the "Other" section in uploads, it would help if it gave the option to type a category<br> :date: __2020-01-21 17:38:45__
