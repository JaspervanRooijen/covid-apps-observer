### Description
> We designed our prescription delivery service to make our customers' lives a bit easier. We know that finding the time to collect your prescription from a pharmacy is difficult – and if you do have the time, you've probably got something more interesting to do with it.
<br><strong>How does it make my life easier?</strong>
<br>You can manage your repeat prescriptions through our app or on our website. With everything in one place, you don't need to call or visit your GP, or even log in to their online ordering system to request a prescription.
<br><strong>How does it work?</strong>
<br><strong>1. Order your prescription</strong>
<br>Search for your medication to request your prescription. When you place an order, we'll send the prescription request to your GP.
<br><strong>2. Pay, or upload exemption</strong>
<br>When your GP sends the prescription back to us, we'll ask you to pay for your order. If you don't pay for your prescriptions, you can upload a photo showing evidence that you don't pay.
<br><strong>3. Delivery</strong>
<br>As soon as your payment has been processed, we'll send your prescription to you via Royal Mail from our online pharmacy in Stoke-on-Trent. Delivery takes between 2 and 3 days.
<br><strong>Due to regulations, we are currently only able to offer our prescription delivery service to customers in England.</strong>

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app doesn't allow you to view to what the gp had sent to the pharmacist. I don't think that I would use these as much apart from if needing to due to that the customer should have the rights to get all the information on them regardless of their prescriptions<br> :date: __2020-08-06 16:19:30__

> Xxxxx<br> :date: __2020-06-15 04:18:40__

> Somewhat confusing site ,could do with a box to write questions, Still waiting for a reply to my last.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 22:10:34__

> Easy to use but had to wait 2 weeks for my tablets to be delivered<br> :date: __2020-05-09 18:23:36__

> Ok if I could actually contact anyone, order stuck at being prepared for a day or two? Then need delivery on top. Need pills in 3 days and no one to contact!<br> :date: __2020-04-25 12:44:39__

> Downloaded this app to help my father out with ordering his medication while he's in lockdiwn due to covid 19 it was good the 1st couple of times when used but when I try an open now all I get is a white screen!<br> :date: __2020-04-20 22:43:51__

> Could do with a bar code reader when adding medication making it easier, and also it should remember your prescription making it easier to reorder.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 08:28:50__

> The issue I had was fixed. However my pharmacy told me if I use this they won't be able to pull my prescriptions anymore so not sure it's worth it<br> :date: __2020-03-05 12:35:36__

> Still waiting for my tablets, a week later today they are my lifeline...<br> :date: __2020-10-21 08:29:14__

> Put my prescription order in and its only sending 2 items what's that all about????????????????<br> :date: __2020-10-09 12:26:57__

> DO NOT TRY. Did not send prescription on time, after everything was cleared. Told the app I run out on the 10th. They emailed that I needed proof of exemption. This was on the 10th. 12 days later they send them off and I went two weeks with no pills. My partner had the same experience and we had to call our surgery to revert to our physical pharmacy. God help the people who desperately need their meds delivered. It was an advert. You can never trust adverts. They never deliver on their promise.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 12:26:17__

> It doesn't allow any form of control over what you can and can't order. You can only order your previous items, some of which you might not need. Basically, useless! I have now gone back to a previous online pharmacy, which I was unhappy with but does have an app and online ordering system that works.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 22:55:13__

> I've not received all of my prescription and run of supply. Terrible experience.<br> :date: __2020-08-31 17:16:22__

> I couldn't find an option to delete my account from within the app or the website. So when I ordered my repeat prescription, it unintentionally went through Well (even tho I ordered it via my local pharmacy on the phone). Customer service wasn't particularly professional either. I would have received my meds by now if it was with my usual pharmacy but I'm still waiting.<br> :date: __2020-08-11 22:56:13__

> Won't let me put in doctor surgery post code<br> :date: __2020-08-05 13:02:01__

> I gave it a 2stars because delivery takes to long to get to you so had to delete account<br> :date: __2020-08-04 12:30:38__

> Started off ok but now I've not received my latest pills and there not resposing to me to tell me why can't track it as not working and I'm due to run out today and I get ill without them not good service<br> :date: __2020-06-18 09:59:24__

> The app is probably ok during normal times but used once during lockdown and medicines took 2 weeks to arrive.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 13:14:22__
