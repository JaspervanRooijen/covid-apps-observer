## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Veterans Affairs (VAC) / Anciens Combattants (ACC) |
| **Website**  | [http://veterans.gc.ca](http://veterans.gc.ca) |
| **Email** | christopher.clissold@canada.ca |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Veterans+Affairs+(VAC)+/+Anciens+Combattants+(ACC)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Veterans+Affairs+(VAC)+/+Anciens+Combattants+(ACC)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Assist in my focus toward an emotional and mental state of clarity and more calmness throuh my daily life. There are good reminders in thIs app about the simple things that can be done to bring serenity to oneself.	For myself with a sustained severe traumatic brain injury ovet 20 yrs ago a number of my symptoms were listed as ptsd like. The techniques used in this app are so beneficial to my sense of mental clarity. They are some Ive used for a long tome and some are new.<br> :date: __2013-12-23 17:55:10__

> One major problem is after you setup the personalized Images and Audio file connections for you application during the initial startup setup do not move those files at anytime after the setup from those directories because you'll have to run Setup from the main screen for those file again and when you do you'll have to select Images or Audio buttons to reestablish those file connections it causes the application to crash, then the application will not run and you will have to Uninstall and Re-Install the application to repair the file connections.<br> :date: __2017-03-18 18:22:11__

> Here's an idea: how about you fund mental health properly? This app has some useful tools but it's not the same as real therapy with a human being on the other end.<br> :date: __2014-11-26 04:16:20__

> The government puts so much weight on out dated research. Its studying the 
effects of war as perceived in the 80s. That's how far behind it is and yet 
that's not even close to the right generation. Our boys have been asked to 
do something for their country that the country doesnt even understand and 
the government thinks a little app will make fix the optics ... cute<br> :date: __2018-04-17 11:18:30__

> PTSD coach Canada cannot be installed   this is the message I keep receiving, great waste of money to create a uses app<br> :date: __2017-05-16 15:10:28__

> Cumbersome, too difficult to manage, not effective or useful due to level of effort to interfaces.<br> :date: __2013-12-25 11:59:31__
