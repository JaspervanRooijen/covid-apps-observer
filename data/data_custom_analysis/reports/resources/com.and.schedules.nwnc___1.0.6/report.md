## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Ice Cream Sandwich, version 4.0.3 - 4.0.4 (API level 15) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Would be nice when you search a class you could see what day and which location it is at. When I search a class it shows me the day I am on now I have to click on each day to see if it is even located at the location I selected. Not very user friendly. Could use alot more updating. No water fitness schedule.<br> :date: __2020-01-22 18:41:19__

> I have been using your website for pool reservations at Jerry Long, for several weeks, successfully. But now, when I find an open lane, fill out the name and birth date info, and click "reserve", nothing happens, other than to blank the boxes that I just filled in. Result is I don't get a reservation for a lane that presumably is open and available. Bummer I Called the Y about this some day last week, but to no avail!. Double bummer!<br> :date: __2020-08-02 19:33:07__

> Doesn't seem to work. Won't let me make pool reservations with it. Needs to be updated.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 14:20:59__
