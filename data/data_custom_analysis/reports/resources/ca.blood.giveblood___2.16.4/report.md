## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Makes it easy to schedule and reschedule appointments. I really like the stat tracking, and the appointment reminders. One reccommendation: please don't have the clinic search default to whole blood. I thought the app wouldn't allow me to book plasma appointments.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 01:59:35__

> Works well.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 06:04:03__

> It looks nice, and better than phone booking. It's also nice that you can fill out the survey, get a Q-Pass easily, have a digital donor card, and track your stats. But it's buggy sometimes, and I don't usually trust the "available days" calendar since days "without availability" still have bookable slots when you click them.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 02:04:44__

> Very knowledgeable staff<br> :date: __2020-09-27 15:46:07__

> Easy and convenient<br> :date: __2020-09-17 17:17:52__

> Great interface for saving lives.<br> :date: __2020-08-02 20:49:21__

> The app is handy for having all your info in one place, definitely helpful for the electronic questionnaire and q-pass<br> :date: __2020-07-15 16:15:01__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-06-30 21:25:16__

> good<br> :date: __2020-06-23 16:17:58__

> Took a bit to get started, help desk was amazing. Up and running now, booking appointments into 2021.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 09:16:40__

> It would be amazing if the app could tell you when your blood donation was used by someone. Positive feedback loop.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 00:31:30__



#### 3-star reviews

> It would be nice if you received a notice when your blood is used. Having that feedback to know you helped change a life.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 01:35:08__

> The dates just show up as Aug...so you have to click on it to find the date and if the date isn't going to work you have to start all over again, not very user friendly.<br> :date: __2020-07-22 00:44:38__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-05-25 13:04:37__

> Remarkable. Lovely!<br> :date: __2020-04-27 03:37:33__

> Its ok and i like not having to carry my card around. Search funtionality is kinda frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-02-17 02:43:46__

> Difficult to find clinics in rural areas<br> :date: __2019-11-08 01:22:05__

> Clunky at best<br> :date: __2019-11-04 20:29:31__

> I wish I was able to see upcoming appointments even when I have an appointment scheduled as I want to see if any other better options are available before cancelling my appointment<br> :date: __2019-07-31 01:49:56__

> Don't like the repeated requests for access to contacts & location. I'm not a milennial. I value my privacy. Wish the app would remember my privacy preferences. Other than that, it works well.<br> :date: __2019-07-20 22:54:21__

> I had book an appointment on 1st July and the location was not open on that day and its not update and I went there for nothing. It should at least update the schedule if the event is cancel or pospone.<br> :date: __2019-07-02 21:41:11__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Since the COVID-19 started, the app has become useless. Book at your favorite location and they cancel the event about 6 weeks before. You'd think if they have issues with a site, they'd just stop using it completely. Instead they try to transfer the set appointments 15 kms away. If they cancel an event, they should just notify you the appointment is cancelled. If we wanted an appointment at the 2nd location, we would have booked it there. The app needs to do what it is supposed to do.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 04:41:28__

> Won't let me install my donor card number<br> :date: __2020-05-27 03:17:25__

> It was not obvious how to book a time after selecting a day.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 22:46:14__

> The new version sucks. I cant make new appointments . It doesn't tell me when I'm eligible to make new appointments and wont tell me where blood drives are being held because my last appointment is still listed ( I cant get rid of it) and it says it wont show new places while I have an upcoming (3 weeks ago) appointment. And by the looks of it the developers could care less that there are these errors because they've not answered anyones comments.<br> :date: __2019-12-10 22:25:15__

> Broken. It wont send me verification email but I still get all the marketing emails. Techs support and staff at the donation centers unable to fix the issues and associate my card with the app even after multiple calls and locations and attempts. So it's useless.<br> :date: __2019-11-22 21:30:48__

> Useless<br> :date: __2019-10-16 18:18:10__

> Problems changing appointment times within the same day<br> :date: __2019-09-27 15:09:36__

> I find the information great. However trying to book an appointment is nearly impossible. It took several attempts<br> :date: __2019-09-25 23:45:26__

> Kinda annoyed really... tried to reschedule on the app and as it turns out it was unable to do so while I was at work. When I went to do it at home it said I had an appointment in 12 days. Then it refreshed and said I didnt have one booked yet. Then I had to make a totally new appointment. And on appointment day it is really difficult to get the questionnaire to work properly. Not a very smooth system in my experience.<br> :date: __2019-09-10 05:56:10__

> Slow, difficult to use, still says my appointment from 2 weeks ago is booked so it won't let me schedule my next. Screen has to be turned very bright to scan<br> :date: __2019-09-03 15:37:28__



#### 1-star reviews

> It won't let me book my next appointment after going to my first one. I'll have to call now.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 01:50:02__

> Unacceptable password reset system. Frustrating. Poor instructions.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 11:19:14__

> Demanded my donor number "if " I had received it already. I hadn't but it would not let me continue. The registration seemed to suggest I didn't need my number yet, hence the "If". I'm trying to do my part and I can't believe this app won't let me register.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 05:44:17__

> Garbage app, we need blood donations an myself, wife and kid cannot register because we all apparently have accounts... What a joke. Still a garbage app. I've registered and now I am not able to get into my account. I've set up a new password, then inputted said password and it says it's still wrong. Absolute trash of an application, all I want to do is donate blood.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 22:09:00__

> There was no q-pass on the app after completing the questionnaire on my laptop so I had to redo it on my tiny cell screen 😑😠<br> :date: __2020-04-29 16:39:39__

> Booking Plasma appointments do not work.<br> :date: __2020-03-24 01:58:27__

> Appointment times don't load<br> :date: __2020-03-17 21:12:34__

> This app never works. Every time I log in, it gives me problems. Either it can't find any donor centres near me (there are many close by) or it doesn't let me log in and tells me an error has occurred. I hate it.<br> :date: __2020-03-15 21:01:27__

> Bad<br> :date: __2020-01-24 18:40:54__

> Unfortunately, the app doesn't work. Keeps loading forever.<br> :date: __2019-12-18 15:43:36__
