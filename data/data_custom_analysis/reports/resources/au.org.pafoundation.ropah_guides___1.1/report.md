### Description
> The ROPAH Guides application provides an online portal for the publication and distribution of interactive ebooks specifically designed to educate patients about radiation therapy and associated healthcare practices performed at the Ipswich Road and Raymond Terrace Radiation Oncology campuses, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.
<br>The development of this resource is an initiative of the Princess Alexandra Hospital’s Cancer Services Division and PA Research Foundation.
<br>All content available for download in the ROPAH Guides is produced by qualified health care professionals with experience in Radiation Oncology and is reviewed prior to publication by a multidisciplinary team employed by the Princess Alexandra Hospital’s Cancer Services Division.
<br>In clinical use, the ROPAH Guides application is recommended to patients after attending a consultation with their Radiation Oncology Specialist at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Patients can then download specific ebook content from within the application onto their smart phone or tablet device.
<br>The ebook content featured for download in the ROPAH Guides is not a replacement for specific medical advice and should be viewed by patients only as directed by a Radiation Oncologist.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
