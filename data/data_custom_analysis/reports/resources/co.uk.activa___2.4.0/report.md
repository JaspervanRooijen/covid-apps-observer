## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Loved the old version, used it regularly in my day to day job as a nurse. 
The new version isn't as easy to use and is also not as efficient at 
garment selecting. I no longer use it in patient consultations.<br> :date: __2018-06-05 07:53:23__
