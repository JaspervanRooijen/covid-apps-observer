### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's awkward that the 'other symptoms' box is at the bottom of a page. This is the only place you need to type, but its position means that the keyboard covers it up. It would be better to be on its own in a new page.<br> :date: __2020-05-17 14:45:19__

> A very good app with a quick and easy daily questionnaire, However it some time will not let you take the questions for a few days as my profile is unavailable and I need to create a new profile but 2 days later my profile is back and it works fine... Is this a known issue?<br> :date: __2020-05-17 14:01:04__

> Doesn't give you any other information about the virus, and it is the same question every single day no update on what is happen in real time , and also doesn't tell you where to get tested or if you qualify for it<br> :date: __2020-05-17 12:25:08__

> Won't load, won't let create profile or answer all questions<br> :date: __2020-05-16 16:05:45__

> I contributed data for several weeks but am expecting an NHS app may be introduced so am discontinuing this one.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 14:18:53__

> I think I got COVID-19 before and I just started the app at the end when I didn't have almost any symptoms. On the FAQs says than I can't report previous symptoms but I can't find any option like that. Also, I am going to start working in a hospital soon but I can't find any option where I can change my profile and let the app knows I will be working with COVID-19 patients.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 15:16:37__

> CAN NO LONGER GET INTO APP Unless I am in a WiFi hotspot although it worked well for the first two weeks!<br> :date: __2020-05-14 21:30:06__

> Mobile version has poor typing interface. Keyboard hides what you are typing, and to see what you have typed, you press the back-page arrow..it works most times, but occasionally it reverts to the entry page..after all the typing you have already done! Why not allow each question to have it's own typing field? Sorry, but I think this is very poor!<br> :date: __2020-05-14 17:54:30__

> I installed this app because the developer said I would receive a county level infection rate estimation after I submitted my daily response. I received an estimation during my first week of use (Mid April). However, I stopped receiving an estimation after my second week of use. I emailed the developer multiple times regarding this issue and have yet to receive a response. I will uninstall unless the estimations return.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 00:09:50__
