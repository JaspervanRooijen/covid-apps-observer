### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It seems a little basic in terms of information gathered, but maybe simplicity is good.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 10:16:01__

> Easy to use. But not sure the frequency of information needed<br> :date: __2020-05-22 18:55:42__

> Some days it is easy<br> :date: __2020-05-22 18:19:57__

> Fine. Simple to use. Took 2-3 minutes to do initial register and report. Only takes 1 minute to report. Only small gripe is when you type in the box at the bottom of a screen you can't see what you're typing because the keyboard gets in the way of the text box and the screen doesn't move up to accommodate both. Otherwise okay.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 14:27:34__

> Should remind me<br> :date: __2020-05-22 14:26:06__

> Very simple but doesn't ask about social activity.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 06:45:38__

> I started contributing to this some time ago, but then the app decided to update itself and completely turned my phone inside out, and I lost a lot of contacts etc. I can't see any way of contributing on my windows laptop. During lockdown whenever either phone or laptop has a little moment I suddenly feel very very lonely as I live alone. I fear I shall feel the same about the contact tracing app if it ever becomes available<br> :date: __2020-05-18 16:52:03__

> Doesn't give you any other information about the virus, and it is the same question every single day no update on what is happen in real time , and also doesn't tell you where to get tested or if you qualify for it<br> :date: __2020-05-17 12:25:08__
