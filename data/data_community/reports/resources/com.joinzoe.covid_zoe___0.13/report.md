### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I'm sure more clarity will come when more details come today. The app is easy to use. Ive registered my poorly uncle onto it as well. Check in every day is quick and really simple. No complaints.

> Very straightforward. Would like to be reminded to update my information though.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 09:33:06__

#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="3_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 3 reviews"/>
</p>

> Easy to use. Not sure how effective it will be.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 09:25:59__

> Not enough questions about pre existing conditions or treatment, surgery that could mask or present or be similar to varied covid symptoms<br> :date: __2020-05-10 23:43:17__

> Limited but worthwhile til something with more detailed reporting options emerges<br> :date: __2020-05-10 21:13:57__

> The app is a great idea but needs lots of work. I added my child to the app who is under 18 but the app still asks all the questions relating to adults such as if they work in health care or look after someone. Please get this sorted please then I will give a better rating.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 20:49:09__

> The app works fine until you want to answer yes to the questions requiring no or yes on the section asking if you need support. My Daughter has additional , so needs one too one support. Its as if the 3 questions do not want you too answer yes.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 18:56:30__

> Keeps dropping out or not moving forward on clicks<br> :date: __2020-05-10 16:31:47__

> Latest updates are a big step backwards. Very laggy, takes ages to call up my profile, then calls me Bob for some reason... Finding it almost unusable. Think you gonna be losing participants very quickly...<br> :date: __2020-05-10 16:27:24__

> It asks questions, you answer job done<br> :date: __2020-05-10 11:55:20__

> Very simple and straightforward for about 5 days. Now I cannot even find the questions. So I give up !<br> :date: __2020-05-10 11:42:43__

> Found some of the questions intrusive and unnecessary. Example...are you still having periods?...seriously?<br> :date: __2020-05-10 09:53:38__

> Great idea... however. "Create account" screen is unusable as my keyboard covers the fields. Please redesign so I can actually create an account.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 08:27:55__

> Daily reminders just do not seem to work, yes I have permissions granted and sometimes (very infrequently) I receive a reminder. Surely that should be a prime objective of this app, to remind you to report.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 22:51:04__

> It lost my profile today.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 21:05:39__

> App is OK its better now its updated to add family members. Shame can't add past information though . Downside is that I changed to Samsung from apple and now dont get the daily notifications to do it and keep being logged out . Edited to add since changing phones its been impossible to do it. App isn't working great at all and all over the place<br> :date: __2020-05-10 16:25:31__

> Today the app lost all my details after using it for the past 4 weeks. That is all. :-/<br> :date: __2020-05-10 15:57:49__

> Happy to help at first, then a few days ago started locking up my phone and had no profile. Added again and now have two. Can't get rid of extra one and get two notifications now. Unfortunately uninstalling now.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 15:56:28__

> Poor app. Gradually asks more and more questions you can't skip to mine data. Not impressed.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 14:53:05__

> why are you not collecting gender and age.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 19:17:18__

> Suboptimal<br> :date: __2020-05-06 12:17:16__

> What does it mean to have "sex assigned at birth"? By whom? Surely sex is assigned at conception, by reality.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 10:27:32__

> Tried installing this but it simply doesn't appear on my phone.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 21:04:25__

> Last update broke the app so can no longer report<br> :date: __2020-05-10 20:07:08__

> Stopped working. Reinstalled twice, but now shows as installed on google play and so won't let me reinstall.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 17:01:56__

> Useless<br> :date: __2020-05-10 16:55:22__

> Does not work since update/ name change. This easy to use app no longer works. My profile disappeared and I can no longer sign in - instead I get sent round in a loop asking me to choose my country of residence. I found this slightly disappointing as I thought it was concentrating on cases within the UK.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 16:35:35__

> Been using the app for about a month, went to use it today and it's lost my profile?<br> :date: __2020-05-10 16:19:54__

> After about 2 weeks of using it daily it lost my profile. It was like I had never set one up. I don't trust it now it seems to have lost my data. Uninstalled<br> :date: __2020-05-10 15:56:46__

> Not working today 10th May 2020<br> :date: __2020-05-10 15:51:33__

> Its stopped working, asks you to log your results and says something has gone wrong<br> :date: __2020-05-10 15:47:29__
