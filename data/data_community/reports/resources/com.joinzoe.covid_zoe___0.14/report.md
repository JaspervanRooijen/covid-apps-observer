### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A worthy cause. App is generally easy to use, but not super easy.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 19:25:14__

> The app works OK. I am running it on an Android emulator on my PC as I don't have a smart phone. It would be more convenient to have a Windows version.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:10:36__

> The app was easy to install. The only slight problem was that I was using an out of date version which didn't update automatically. So I had to uninstall the old version and install a new one.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 12:18:04__

> Really easy to use and contributes to Covid 19 research. I am amending my review as I have been experiencing a problem. I use this app every day but I am not sure if all my responses are getting through. When I go to enter my info it says I haven't reported, eg today it says my last report was 3 days ago and yesterday it said my last report was 4 days ago!<br> :date: __2020-06-14 10:39:22__

> Great idea and I'm happy to contribute daily data. But app keeps showing notifications to check in when I already have and pressed Done. It would be nice to have some feedback over time to help keep up the "streak" of reporting, otherwise starts to feel a little useless sending data about how not sick I am into the void. It would be great to have an opt in button for contact tracing.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 16:43:50__

> Fel like I am contributing in a small way. . Feel more info could be added. But good idea.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 17:40:37__

> I've just started using the app again. I had to re-register because I changed my email provider and couldn't change it on here.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 14:36:20__

> Would like to see level of out breaks in local area not county. Seem very general at the moment eg 10 in Chester.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 08:01:14__

> I've had to reinstall three days in a row. Was fine until the<br> :date: __2020-06-12 18:21:24__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-06-12 14:42:03__

> Easy to use, though covid free up to now.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:12:13__

> Very easy to use, but hasn't reminded me to report every day in spite of having notifications switched on<br> :date: __2020-06-10 16:37:15__

> The questions are quite limiting<br> :date: __2020-06-09 20:51:30__

> App ok, but uses space on already nearly full phone. Just had to remove it and deleat some photos again.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 10:23:20__

> It would be better if this had tracking so we all know who is safe and who isn't.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 18:05:09__

> Downloaded but will not open to do anything. Maybe it's the area<br> :date: __2020-06-10 14:48:56__

> Is this the app the government want us to install, I've seen so many?<br> :date: __2020-06-07 22:13:53__

> Good idea but bad user experience. Unnecessary clicks by asking every single day if you've been tested for the virus. Also the arrival screen (the blue one with the button to report is) is messy.<br> :date: __2020-06-07 15:50:07__

> Hold lot of junk mail since got this. Avoid !!<br> :date: __2020-06-05 17:25:30__

> The app worked very well for weeks but has now crashed. A message comes up that the Covid Symptom Study has stopped. Is this due to the latest update on 8th June?<br> :date: __2020-06-13 19:58:55__

> Took twenty minutes to provide all my information, including health, travel, shopping, work etc. AFTER all that it asks for an email address and password. It THEN asks for the same information all over again. I don't have 40 minutes spare to install ONE app.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 13:57:37__
