### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy just need to remember to do it. If it helps them understand the infection patterns then I'm all for it. Use it for 2 adults and 2 school children...<br> :date: __2020-11-08 12:20:22__

> Simple to complete and hopefully will get us out of this mess quicker.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 10:38:16__

> Mostly good but its not possible to fix an error in medical registration data.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 09:51:57__

> Quick and easy<br> :date: __2020-11-07 21:57:27__

> Good app but doesn't seem to ask all the right questions (e.g., are you on your period, how long ago was your contact with a vivid positive person, alternative causes for your symptoms, etc.).<br> :date: __2020-11-07 18:36:06__

> App works seamlessly, but there's a lot to read for dunces like me with a short attention span<br> :date: __2020-11-07 13:47:36__

> I have enjoyed being part of this project for several months. However the app has failed to work for the last 2 days even tho i reinstalled it, checked my phone etc. Today it is working again.

> Display issues with font causing numbers and text to be hidden or missing off the app. Makes local totals switch from 6000 to 600. No special non-standard font sizes running on phone.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 03:28:52__

> App starts up with the date it was last used. Only way to update it to today is to force quit via Android and then reopen. Could be distorting stats? No feedback option in-app. Edit: now won't open at all. Worthy cause, flaky software. Edit: now works again.<br> :date: __2020-11-06 13:02:49__

> I'm reporting every day but the app keeps saying I've missed 1, 2, 3 or more days! I haven't! If this is happening to lots of app users it's distorting the data. Please fix this error.<br> :date: __2020-11-06 12:56:33__

> Reporting has too many steps<br> :date: __2020-11-06 11:17:20__

> Good, but the app has now stopped working, and immediately goes to a white screen on start-up. Tried reinstalling, but the same problem occurs.<br> :date: __2020-11-06 10:50:00__

> Not very good. Entered the results of a very recent test, tried to continue and it asked me to 'add new test' which I had just done of course. Exited the app, reentered and had the same problem. 'Add new test' should have been a simple 'Continue'<br> :date: __2020-11-05 12:20:26__

> Has never displayed local case count properly.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 06:55:18__

> Virtual keyboard covers input boxes and unable to scroll screen to see what is being typed; this applies to password box and other symptoms box. Second day I opened app I was receiving an unhelpful error code (request failed 525) and the app locked. However, the tick box lists of symptoms is impressive and very easy to track.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 11:04:48__

> Fair<br> :date: __2020-11-02 09:58:05__

> Not easy to bypass a page that doesn't apply to me i.e school, uni page in Profile update. Have had to reinstall, as yesterday, I got a 525 error and could not connect.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 13:30:03__

> Reminder keeps disappearing, no longer get the weekly questions asked just don't think it is working correctly but have no way of finding out<br> :date: __2020-11-06 12:39:16__

> Having problem with the app crashing. Restarted my phone (android) twice, uninstalled and reinstalled app, still crashing just as it comes to "Report today.....", left with inactive blank screen. No issues prior to this.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 15:32:53__

> Great app, just takes up loads of space and you can't move it to your SD card<br> :date: __2020-10-30 10:10:15__

> Not great. Does anyone understand the figures quoted on the interactive map? I don't think I'm thick but it's pretty meaningless in comparison to figures quoted elsewhere.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 19:49:21__

> Really useful...but missing a zero/decimal place? E.g. 2572 shown as 257?<br> :date: __2020-10-27 16:46:06__

> The app is good bit it's missing one digit off all the numbers. So it looks like there are just 75 cases of covid locally but it must be 750+. I know this as I can see numbers like 4,560,09 please fix it!<br> :date: __2020-10-23 00:44:08__

> Rubbish! The app will not move past the test questions. Constantly asks for new test info. Cannot complete the process.I have uninstalled it, that is how I deal with apps that do not work!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 12:01:04__

> Bugs that mean you can't fill things out properly are frustrating. I spent a long time answering multiple questions it was a little unclear that I was supposed to be focusing on pre covid and that there would be a second set of questions but like many friends of mine when arriving at the questions to answer for during lockdown the software froze and I could only exit in the hope I could go back but unfortunately exiting meant I no longer had an option to finish the survey<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:52:09__

> I created an account and had no trouble for the first couple of days. I now can't log in. There is also no option to change the password. What has happened? Review update The only way I could use the app was to create a new account with a different email address. I cannot now input my daily health as the new update asks about blood pressure meds and won't let me reply 'no', it just asks me to answer the question. so I can't move on the the next screen. Needs further updates 05/11/20 Update: After working well all summer, the app has now stopped working. I just get a blank screen. I have tried uninstall/reinstall and still get a blank screen. Any ideas?<br> :date: __2020-11-05 19:05:24__
