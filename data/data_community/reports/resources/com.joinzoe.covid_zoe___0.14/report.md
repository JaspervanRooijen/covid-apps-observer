### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I've been using the app for months, reporting every day, and enjoyed knowing I was helping research. Unfortunately I've been unable to open the app for nearly two weeks now, despite reinstalling it several times. Very strange, and disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-09-08 11:31:56__

> i cannot add daily updates for my partner or child as the app asks for their blood group. We don't know their blood group! no way to by-pass this.<br> :date: __2020-09-07 20:11:12__

> NO NOTIFICATIONS! I've lost the daily reminder, tried the suggested remedies but no luck. I only remember every few days. Does this mean my data is not useful?<br> :date: __2020-09-06 10:12:07__

> Glad to be part of the research.<br> :date: __2020-09-06 08:47:46__

> Don't know any other way to contact the developer. I'm trying to fill in the diet study, but there is no way to save responses. Twice now I have got part way through, and then lost everything (once because of a low battery warning, once because I flicked over to another app to check info to fill in, and this app decided to restart when I switched back to it). Other than that, the app's fine - a few niggles that others have mentioned, like text boxes covered up by keyboard, but a good tool.<br> :date: __2020-09-05 11:54:15__

> Good reporting app.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 23:36:36__

> The 'weekly' updates are far from weekly, the last on was 13th August, it's now 4th September and no further update. You either have a weekly update or don't have one? Bit of a relaxed approach it seems!<br> :date: __2020-09-03 19:52:31__

> 3rd time I've tried to complete. Managed this time.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 08:37:34__

> Login issues. Can't even reset my password to login again. It recognises that my email address is registered so can't register again. There's no option for password reset. Edit: Update allowed me to reset my password. It seems to be working fine. The 'local infections' updates are now more localised to Borough. Bugbear: I don't mind reporting any symptoms but why does it have to be everyday even if you're well? Also, even if it's once a day, how I feel may change by the end of the day.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 21:37:11__

> Unable to share map of cases in Barnet. App just appears to restart.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 16:17:27__

<p align="center">

</p>

> Latest update and all the numbers are missing the last digit. Get things like 8 cases in your area but it means 80 cases. Or 4,123,12 cases, but that's not a real number. You really need to get the numbers working<br> :date: __2020-09-07 21:49:19__

> I'm stuck on the page asking for info re: mobility and personal help. The answer to the 4 questions is NO. But stuck and can't move on to the next question.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 17:06:10__

> Good until it stopped working. I've been using for months, but has stopped loading for the last 4 days. Is it no longer applicable for users in Scotland? Wish someone would answer at zoe!<br> :date: __2020-09-01 16:50:52__

> I got tired of doing this because of small bugs in the survey that "bugged" me. They asked for feedback which I spent some time providing, but then they didn't implement any fixes. The last straw was utilizing the platform to sell a $400 personalized diet program which also, supposedly, was for some kind of research purpose. I wanted to help with the science part of the Covid 19 study. But it's obvious that nobody is doing anything with the data. Scam!<br> :date: __2020-08-26 18:43:25__

> \*\*\*\*\*\* Behaves normally when offline, however data is discarded. It would be easy to lose data accidentally. App should report an error when offline. \*\*\*\*\*\* Easy to use, except some questions are can be hidden by the keyboard. Cannot access menu without creating account. Very hard to find in Android Playstore. Can't edit user data to correct mistakes, nor review it. Code could be open source.<br> :date: __2020-08-26 09:37:02__

> Doesn't seem to work properly nor open correctly. Hence I'm not using it very often. Then when open it there is always long questionnaire. Never just symptoms and go as I had expected.<br> :date: __2020-08-15 08:39:50__

> Was great at first. Now it will not let me provide my symptoms as I do not know my blood type and it wants to know that before I can do anything.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 17:55:46__

> Seems to have been disabled on chrome computers<br> :date: __2020-09-08 23:07:16__

> Pointless<br> :date: __2020-09-08 13:16:11__

> I can't log in anymore. Even though I have tried to and also tried to reset. But it says, there is an account with the emails.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 23:24:15__

> The only reason I wanted to download the app was to keep track of infections in my area. I wasn't expecting to have to give over so much personal information that will probably be sold on to the highest bidder. I uninstalled it when I was asked date of birth, height, weight, address, in what way was I in contact with people etc... I just want to know what the local infection rates are.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 16:52:15__

> I reported my current health status to this website for months, via Google Play. Unfortunately 2 weeks ago the Report Now button on the opening page disappeared and none of the links from the page permit me to report either. I notified them on 24 August. They acknowledged but nothing has improved. The most recent "no-reply" email I got from Tim Spector about altering postcodes shows 3 example pages. The opening one on the left clearly has a Report Now button which would be fine if only I could ever access one like it. I'm hoping this review might generate some action from the web organisers.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 14:00:08__

> Language is tight to the region. So it is useless for me. We should start having a more global view.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 10:50:08__

> I have not been able to enter my personal data for 8 days now as I cannot find the data entry page on the version that comes up on my computer.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 15:38:58__

> Completely broken. Won't even launch. Just installed on 8/30/2020, and it immediately crashes when opening.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 09:04:17__

> 4 attempts to set up an account. Trying for 5th and final time. Set up screen will not move after you have entered Email and PW<br> :date: __2020-08-29 08:55:47__

> Well I would like to help out , bit since the sign up page won't let me progress being age / height I won't bother<br> :date: __2020-08-28 20:44:10__
