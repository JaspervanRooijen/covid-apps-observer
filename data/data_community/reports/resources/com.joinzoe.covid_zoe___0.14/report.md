### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It takes ages to set this up. The quid pro quo is supposed to be daily, accurate Covid data - but the data has not been updated since I've been using the app!<br> :date: __2020-06-21 20:52:40__

> Post update did not recognise my login details.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 11:57:29__

> App is straight forward but I would like feedback on other users in and around my area. It now allows me to check my area. But click on the area and it gives 3 graphs. Which one is mine. Top middle or bottom. Frankly I dont think they care as long as the revenue keeps coming in<br> :date: __2020-06-19 19:57:19__

> App slow and crashes frequently<br> :date: __2020-06-19 11:43:10__

> originally installed on my tab. However after first use would not open. On my phone it seems to be ok. It has stopped working on my phone<br> :date: __2020-06-19 07:35:27__

> As a long term study feel this is fairly pointless why not ask when you believe you were ill, including a tick list of symptoms at that time and then a continuing tick list of symptoms going forward.<br> :date: __2020-06-15 10:45:33__

> App ok, but uses space on already nearly full phone. Just had to remove it and deleat some photos again.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 10:23:20__

> Not interested<br> :date: __2020-06-20 13:54:30__

> I suffer with aspergers and found the app to have easy to answer questions, however I think some of the questions needed more options as I have been bleeding longer than 6 weeks so couldn't answer question correctly. And when I finished the questions the website won't work so couldn't find if anyone in my area has/suspected covid. I still don't feel safe or reassured by this app.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 11:29:10__

> Can't progress beyond the introductory questions about being able to get out and wherher needing walking aids. At this stage it just stops and progresses no further. Is this app clever enough to assess my veracity? ðŸ˜³ Will have to uninstall. Quick question: just how secure is this app?<br> :date: __2020-06-20 10:39:39__

> After I click PROFILE to self-report I am presented with a list of over two dozen studies and need to check one prior to proceeding. NONE of the surveys listed is "COVID Symptom Study." Don't know what to check - so not self reporting anything<br> :date: __2020-06-16 18:43:10__

> Good idea. But, poorly written. App can not be moved to external SD memory<br> :date: __2020-06-15 13:50:07__

> Read the privacy policy and the terms of use.<br> :date: __2020-06-15 06:15:15__

> The app worked very well for weeks but has now crashed. A message comes up that the Covid Symptom Study has stopped. Is this due to the latest update on 8th June?<br> :date: __2020-06-13 19:58:55__
