### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Help prevent the virus<br> :date: __2020-09-14 14:47:33__

> I have been using this to track things following being ill in March. The one feature that could do with being updated is the "tell us about your hospital treatment" section. People with "long-covid" don't really have anywhere to update any later checks without suggesting they have been in hospital with covid again.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 14:23:57__

> Okay<br> :date: __2020-09-14 14:06:31__

> Easy to use. Questionnaires sometimes slow to respond<br> :date: __2020-09-14 11:39:26__

> overall but some options limited eg max excercise with increased heart rate is once a week. Including a child's school if the school has not been signed up stops you moving on etc but school not registered.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 09:25:11__

> Lengthy at start but thorough. My screen froze a couple of times during initial questionaire but I persisted and info was saved/logged. Day two so getting familiar still. Seems user friendly.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 09:10:09__

> Recommended to me by a friend. Passed it on to several of mine as want to try and do something to help. Not too onerous an app.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 08:46:29__

> Stopped sending notifications and then stopped working so have reinstalled<br> :date: __2020-09-14 14:16:50__

> Not that intuitive<br> :date: __2020-09-14 09:09:55__

> A few bugs to iron out. Mine stops working half way through the diet questionnaire.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 14:02:53__

> User friendly except for 2 things: 1. Would get more users in Wales if it had a Welsh language version (I have several family members who rarely speak English so would prefer questions in Welsh, which is after all our official language). 2. Some of the multi-choice options did not include the response which I wanted to give, so I was forced to give a wrong answer (my favourite one was the question about how often you drink alcohol - there was no option to answer 'every day'!)<br> :date: __2020-09-11 10:28:35__

> Bit slow. Answers/options too narrow range<br> :date: __2020-09-11 09:19:48__

> I was reporting daily but my notifications have stopped so I just don't realise I haven't done it. I've checked all my app notifications settings and it 'should' be OK.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 19:19:53__

> I am repeatedly asked to report on a day I have already reported. The app tells me I missed the previous day when I know I reported<br> :date: __2020-09-13 10:04:19__

> Latest update and all the numbers are missing the last digit. Get things like 8 cases in your area but it means 80 cases. Or 4,123,12 cases, but that's not a real number. You really need to get the numbers working<br> :date: __2020-09-07 21:49:19__

> I'm stuck on the page asking for info re: mobility and personal help. The answer to the 4 questions is NO. But stuck and can't move on to the next question.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 17:06:10__

> Good until it stopped working. I've been using for months, but has stopped loading for the last 4 days. Is it no longer applicable for users in Scotland? Wish someone would answer at zoe!<br> :date: __2020-09-01 16:50:52__

> I got tired of doing this because of small bugs in the survey that "bugged" me. They asked for feedback which I spent some time providing, but then they didn't implement any fixes. The last straw was utilizing the platform to sell a $400 personalized diet program which also, supposedly, was for some kind of research purpose. I wanted to help with the science part of the Covid 19 study. But it's obvious that nobody is doing anything with the data. Scam!<br> :date: __2020-08-26 18:43:25__

> \*\*\*\*\*\* Behaves normally when offline, however data is discarded. It would be easy to lose data accidentally. App should report an error when offline. \*\*\*\*\*\* Easy to use, except some questions are can be hidden by the keyboard. Cannot access menu without creating account. Very hard to find in Android Playstore. Can't edit user data to correct mistakes, nor review it. Code could be open source.<br> :date: __2020-08-26 09:37:02__

> I got so far in registration and it would not let me any further. This happened several times. I thought help was required with this PANDEMIC!!!!! Still will not let me log in?? I JUST GIVE UP. MINUS 10 STARS. YOU KEEP SENDING ME E MAIL THOUGH?????????<br> :date: __2020-09-13 21:55:36__

> Consistently awful at tracking national trends. Their estimates have completely failed to notice any trends until after ONS survey (hugely lagged) or increase in PCR results (quite lagged) when they magically rebalance everything and then pretend they spotted it. You are helping noone except some crusty academics at the largely sidelined kcl get their grants. Which is a shame as the promise/spin of the app is most noble.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 00:47:33__

> App does not update. I have to uninstall and reinstall each time<br> :date: __2020-09-12 15:39:16__

> Useless have been using this app for last 2 months everyday. Today it locks me out for no reason. Cannot log in says missing field when everything filled in. Tried to create a new account error messages. Unistalled turned phone off and on reinstalled nothing works. As a Healthcare professional I believed this app was invaluable and have encouraged so many people to us but now all that data lost including all test results I have religiously put in every day, all gone.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 23:44:52__

> Was working now just a white screen with a blue circle going around<br> :date: __2020-09-10 18:07:57__
