### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very easy and simple<br> :date: __2020-07-05 14:46:37__

> Takes about 20 seconds each day for you to add to this vital research tool.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 14:38:44__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2020-07-05 14:21:03__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2020-07-05 13:29:48__

> It's useful to feel that I'm contributing to an evidence base and in filling it in I have also taken comfort in the efforts of academics/the medical profession in taking the lead on this. I don't know if its accurate take on who's responsibility (ie academic or gov't) it should be to take a lead in ensuring this kind of work is done, but in signing up to it has given me a sense of security that some sensible/intelligent people are taking charge.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 13:22:20__

> Easy to use and very necessary.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 13:16:27__

> Simple to use, clearly important. Good insights from blog and webinars. Later addition - can it be made easier to take the Updates? You're making a lot, but the App only occasionally offers an Update option (to me, anyway). Later update: The App no longer allows me to update it. Google Play tells me only that it's 'Installed', and if I want to reinstall it I have to verify an account that's not my personal one. I've given up - I'll just keep going with what I have, which is now 16 updates behind.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 13:07:30__

> Excellent and a reassuring app.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 13:05:45__

> Bit difficult to get on at first but ok now and the daily reminder is good<br> :date: __2020-07-05 12:03:59__

> Easy to access and full of useful information and opinion.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 10:35:42__

> Great app for a great cause, but I am now uninstalling and will no longer assist due being asked to participate in taking a home test and not realising that you use Amazon to deliver your kids and I have now sat waiting for 11 hours for the kit to be delivered today, including a couple of hours on with Amazon so-called customer service being passed from pillar to post and asked to wait another few hours, then another few. They keep saying delivery attempt failed, but they are not even attempting<br> :date: __2020-07-04 22:07:25__

> No problems hope it helps<br> :date: __2020-07-04 21:55:12__

> It is very handy however it asked me today what my blood group is. Now, I know I'm O- but that isn't one of the options 🤷🏻‍♀️<br> :date: __2020-07-04 21:11:01__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-07-05 12:46:47__

> Basically easy to use but the q about contact with others could have been broken down furrher eg had to visit place with lots if people could have said had to visit place with a few people eg groceries then had to visit place with lots of people eg hospital etc. Also symptoms could include cold symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 06:31:25__

> Wouldn't let me log in for the last few days<br> :date: __2020-07-04 19:59:11__

> As yet, no useful information<br> :date: __2020-07-04 19:09:26__

> Easy to use but lacking some usability features.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 13:50:04__

> Great idea! Could add an easier daily update and prompt.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 12:35:15__

> Unable to complete initial questionnaire. Reinstalled , logged in but now unable to complete profile... Daily reporting seems ok.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 11:57:40__

> All I seem to be able to do is report well or unwell. It flashed up wanting me to add my blood group if Iknow it but there is no way to do this. I can't report the symptoms I had in March either. How do I edit myprofile data?<br> :date: __2020-07-03 10:58:53__

> I am happy to take part, but the interface could be more intuitive. Right it is stick, does not move on. Not good. It only asks me if I want to clear my comments ! No , I wish to submit! Come on Kings college programmer you can do better than this.<br> :date: __2020-07-02 14:43:21__

> Unfortunately after several months usage for a family I've had to uninstall this app as it was using over 250MB storage and I have a midrange device and ran out of room. Why so much data?! The actual survey data I've filled in can't be more than a kB or two if stored efficiently. Disappointed not to be contributing any more.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 13:10:58__

> Limited feedback<br> :date: __2020-06-29 13:50:26__

> This used to be very simple, it took 20 seconds to report. Now they've added pages of questions so I uninstalled. Pity.<br> :date: __2020-06-23 18:37:33__
