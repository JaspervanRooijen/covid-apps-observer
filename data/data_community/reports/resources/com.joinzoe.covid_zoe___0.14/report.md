### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Keeps me involved<br> :date: __2020-09-23 08:19:22__

> This app is very quick to fill in each day, only takes seconds. It is also full of very useful information and helps keep you up to date with results of new studies. Highly recommend.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 08:14:01__

> Easy to use and very informative.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 07:45:15__

> This app is so important! It takes a few minutes to initially set up but around 30 seconds to report daily. It also comes with up to date information about the rate of people showing symptoms in your area. Take a few seconds everyday to report, even if you're healthy. If you start feeling sick, I imagine the questions becone more in depth and, I'm told, you'll get information on how to properly respond. Stay alert, stay safe!<br> :date: __2020-09-23 01:35:31__

> Please download this app. Tracer app it is simply reporting your symptoms. There are over 4 million users and through this app they have found there is six subtypes of the Coronavirus period there are different symptoms than they thought because people are reporting. I wish I could do covid tracing but it's not available in my area. Maybe you guys could incorporate that into it. They asked you to report your symptoms every day and if you have a covid test. They need more people to report.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 00:54:26__

> Very easy and helping with the virus.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 00:16:14__

> App didn't load as usual. Had to reset password to use it<br> :date: __2020-09-23 06:31:50__

> Really good and important app which I've used throughout the pandemic. However daily notification reminders to report have stopped working since I got a new Samsung phone, even after uninstalling the app on my old phone. The same has happened to two friends. The option to turn on notifications just takes us to the notifications menu in Android but there's nothing about the covid app there. Please fix this and help us remember to keep reporting daily!<br> :date: __2020-09-23 01:14:04__

> Takes a lot of information, but seems a little repetative.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 19:34:30__

> Easy to after the initial setup steps<br> :date: __2020-09-22 17:45:11__

> occasional bugs, notifications stopped and I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get them going again. Otherwise the app is easy to use and obviously for a worthwhile cause.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 17:41:48__

> Easy to use on the whole, although you have to click Create Account to access Sign In, which is initially confusing when account already created. Also a bit annoying is not being able to see what you're typing, when reporting extra symptoms/relevant info. I have to click back to ensure correct typing! Update 09/20, new additional questions easy to use. Easier to log in now.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 16:58:16__

> Good to be able to check local cases good to help with any information that might be of use.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 15:46:21__

> Very easy to use!<br> :date: __2020-09-22 14:56:40__

#### 3-star reviews

</p>

> Great idea and I have been a regular, and consistent, user of the app from quite early in the pandemic. Unfortunately, my reporting has become less consistent recently because I no longer receive prompts. Notifications are set on in the operating system settings, so the problem appears to be with the app. The website does not provide contact details for support, directing me instead to feedback here. If this can be fixed, my rating would be 5*.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 16:38:17__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-09-22 16:14:00__

> I think you should be asking about daily interactions and mask wearing, visits to places and relatively risky behaviors.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 08:36:42__

> This app has problems when trying to make an account and password. I got an error the first try, but worked the next day. My husband also got an error but hasn't tried a second time. I emailed the company on the problem and attached a screenshot.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 21:05:45__

> I don't know my blood type, so I can't register, even though I would very much like to. This seems unnecessary. There should be a 'don't know' option.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 17:08:00__

> Brilliant app however can no longer see map data.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 16:05:00__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-09-21 13:59:38__

> Too new to see whether useful to user but researchers will be the ones to assess. Would like Highlands broken into counties!<br> :date: __2020-09-21 11:50:34__

> Since moving to an S10, the daily reminder has stopped working.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 10:53:52__

> Quite troublesome with initial signing in as I had had a Covid test as part of another study. This seemed to confuse the system (& consequently me). Diet listing is comprehensive but very easy to miss sections so better separation would help.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 21:01:36__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="2_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 2 reviews"/>
</p>

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Saturday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 12:25:55__

> Great idea, but...Why do they ask for so much personal info that does not relate to COVID? Thought it would be quick & easy (I'm sure it is after asking & answering several questions about my Aunt Flo & other questions) I un-installed.<br> :date: __2020-09-19 13:56:05__

> I am repeatedly asked to report on a day I have already reported. The app tells me I missed the previous day when I know I reported<br> :date: __2020-09-13 10:04:19__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="1_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 1 reviews"/>

> No longer get a daily reminder to log my status. Notifications are turned on and I have uninstall and reinstalled the app but still no reminders. (Samsung Galaxy S10)<br> :date: __2020-09-22 09:12:46__

> Waste of time and energy, go jump<br> :date: __2020-09-21 14:58:42__

> Behaves normally when offline, however data is silently discarded. It would be easy to lose data accidentally. App should report an error if data cannot be uploaded.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 10:34:24__

> As soon as i installed it, i was getting reminders even after i entered my data. It got too annoying. Im disappointed in the app cuz i thought it would be helpful but its not when itll take my info more than once a day.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 22:20:35__

> Could not install on my samsung a50. It says its installed but there is no icon to click on and no way to get into the app or uninstall. Useless I'm afraid which is a great shame as I would like to help with this pandemic if I can.<br> :date: __2020-09-19 09:33:33__

> If you dont know your blood type dont bother... Was super excited to be part of this went through about 30 questions to get to blood type... Um i dont know so it wont let me move forward... Guess I will uninstall<br> :date: __2020-09-19 05:10:18__

> Notifications have stopped working for last few weeks so after filling out daily since March I now frequently forget. Notification setting doesn't work to switch them on<br> :date: __2020-09-18 08:24:43__

> Impossible to fill out. Blood type is an unskippable question and I don't know mine. Otherwise this would be five stars.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 18:05:46__

> The terms include a class action waiver and arbitration agreement, which I won't accept, so I couldn't use it.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 07:03:28__

> I want to use this app where I'm currently living in Japan but there isn't an option for it. It only says the US, UK, or Sweden.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 05:44:57__
