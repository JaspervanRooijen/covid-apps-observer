### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's a good app in a good cause, but not well written I think. Can't get notifications to work at all. Huawei P20 pro.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 22:54:35__

> 3/8/20 Using app few months, started experiencing issues with recording. Do this every day, yet sometimes it fails to accept information no matter how many times added in. Do updates whenever they appear. Needs to be addressed please.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 16:48:08__

> The user interface can be confusing,<br> :date: __2020-07-31 20:02:02__

> Easy to use, but not entirely sure how useful the information will be to research teams. If I have constant tests or even one test then I think it would be more accurate....<br> :date: __2020-07-31 14:20:10__

> I find the organisation of the data presented rather chaotic.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 12:28:13__

> Not as user friendly as it could be. Questions are poorly worded, choice of answers insufficient to have meaningful data. Not enough users.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 08:53:04__

> Easy to use. Only needs a daily push reminder to be perfect.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 03:35:42__

> App seems to be doing a lot of things at the same time. Interface would be more intuitive if the functions were grouped in some way with a clear path of how to cycle through the groups and functions. E.g daily logging, sign up for trials, review data etc.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 16:03:43__

> no way to say what type of test you had no way to input that you had covid already but a great tool, everything is voluntarily self reported, no privacy concerns<br> :date: __2020-07-29 14:32:05__

> App is convinced that I live in the UK. Unable to update profile even if I delete profile or reload app. No way to contact developers.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 16:07:42__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Too late to report recurrent symptoms I first had months ago before lockdown<br> :date: __2020-08-03 20:33:24__

> Have had this app since March or early April. I report every single day since installation and never had issues until about 2 months ago. The problem is that now, everyday, it has been directing me to report on days that I have already reported. It's as annoying as a fly that won't go away. I sent an email and only received a form letter in return. I'm trying to do my part but will stop and uninstall if not resolved soon.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 23:16:50__

> I would like to contribute, but since the app doesn't give an option to contribute in the English language for people currently residing in Sweden, I am unable to.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 12:20:47__

> Doesn't always remind me to update, very vague about cases in my area even though it knows my postcode<br> :date: __2020-07-28 09:12:43__

> Worked really well for weeks the all of a sudden it won't go past the opening banner page. I've uninstalled it and am in the process of reinstalling it. Still can't open it. Any ideas?<br> :date: __2020-07-23 14:21:01__

> Started off good, just a couple yes/no questions, but after a few upgrades it started asking too many questions and I just felt it was encroaching too much upon my privacy. Now uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-07-22 20:03:35__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="1_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 1 reviews"/>
</p>

> Doesn't need a review to know how bad this is.<br> :date: __2020-08-02 10:07:10__

> Your app needs work. Not capturing all scenarios. Wording isn't clear. Can't see what typing when answering questions.<br> :date: __2020-08-01 12:19:11__

> This is hopeless. I just want to report how I am today, but something comes up asking me to rate the ap and I cant get into the reporting of health bit . Can you explain why ?t<br> :date: __2020-07-30 13:33:56__

> The research goal is admirable if flawed, hence I am using this app, somewhat reluctantly. Every question is so badly worded that it makes me angry every time. The daily notification says "You can stop a COVID hotspot in your area" which is far more alarmist than it needs to be. The daily questions are also terrible, with the main being the meaningless "Are you physically normal?" The experience of using the app is so terrible that I really want to quit, but the research is so important.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 17:52:20__

> I got so far in registration and it would not let me any further. This happened several times. I thought help was required with this PANDEMIC!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-07-28 10:15:06__

> App is missing important questions. Questions about PPE for workers are less useful unless combined with questions about environmental protection such as negative pressure hvac and other environment air and surface treatment regimens.<br> :date: __2020-07-26 13:39:42__
