### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Entering daily report on being well or unwell is a great idea. I haven't chose unwell yet so not sure what options you have after that which is why only 4 stars. Plenty of information though so thumbs up for that.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 13:07:16__

> Very simple to use.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 01:50:18__

> Great app for a great cause, but I am now uninstalling & will no longer able to assist due to being asked to participate in taking a test and not realising that you use Amazon to deliver your kits. I have now sat waiting for 11 hours for the kit to be delivered today, including a couple of hours on with Amazon so-called customer service being passed from pillar to post & asked to wait another few hours, then another few. They keep saying delivery attempt failed, but they are not even attempting.<br> :date: __2020-07-09 21:13:56__

> Some issues leading to a feeling of incomplete answering due to questions not specific enough, or answer you want not available in choice options.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 01:22:30__

> app is keeping me informed<br> :date: __2020-07-09 19:01:06__

> Lots of technical problems. Surprised I still try it.<br> :date: __2020-07-09 15:17:22__

> Easy to use but there's no way of recovering a password once lost. Have tried Reset Password 4 times but no email arrives from the app to let me back in.<br> :date: __2020-07-08 08:56:48__

> App is generally easy to use. But the estimate of "people with symptoms" for my county is staggeringly wrong. I live in Fresno County, CA, where the virus is out of control. For 6-8 weeks, the app's estimate for cases in my county has been steady at around 1,850 cases, or slightly declining. In fact there are >4,600 active cases in the county, and it's been going up by >200 cases PER DAY for the last couple of weeks. I'm tempted to stop using the app so these folks will stop publishing falsely comforting numbers. The virus is out of control in my county, and these folks are completely missing that.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 19:47:55__

> Good app but would like to input symptoms previously had but it did not ask what these were.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 13:34:57__

> App has good intensions but I report every single day without fail but when I open it to report it sometimes says, last reported 2 days ago, even 3 days ago. I've been using it for around 3 months now so I'm not convinced it's very accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 07:57:05__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-07-05 12:46:47__

> Basically easy to use but the q about contact with others could have been broken down furrher eg had to visit place with lots if people could have said had to visit place with a few people eg groceries then had to visit place with lots of people eg hospital etc. Also symptoms could include cold symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 06:31:25__

> Unfortunately after several months usage for a family I've had to uninstall this app as it was using over 250MB storage and I have a midrange device and ran out of room. Why so much data?! The actual survey data I've filled in can't be more than a kB or two if stored efficiently. Disappointed not to be contributing any more.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 13:10:58__
