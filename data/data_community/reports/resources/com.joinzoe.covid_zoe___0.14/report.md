### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use. Interesting maps showing up to date local infection rates.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 11:13:21__

> Teething problems over everything working.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 09:02:54__

> Its so great to be able to take a few short minutes and help a worthwhile cause. My only issue with the app is for the healthcare workers exposure questions, there is no option for working with patient that neither have covid or are nor presumed to have covid, for example surgical patients who have already been screened, tested, and have no symptoms, but are still in hospitals being taken care of by healthcare workers. Hope this feedback helps them fix the issue and get more accurate results<br> :date: __2020-10-01 21:00:07__

> I have had this Ap since launched. I find it Works really well & easy to use. With the added bonus of information from scientist.<br> :date: __2020-10-01 12:06:35__

> Keeping us all safe<br> :date: __2020-10-01 10:16:51__

> Easy and helps yourself track the ailments over the past months, which is surprisingly many, and self explanatory to why I feel certain way due to ailments weeks previously.<br> :date: __2020-10-01 09:27:14__

> Gives better information than the govt are right now 😑<br> :date: __2020-10-01 08:15:49__

> Nice little app<br> :date: __2020-10-01 19:06:28__

> No longer gives me daily notification reminders to complete.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 20:05:22__

> Profile editing needs improvement.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 12:30:51__

> Some feedback... on adding a user profile you force the user to enter a blood group. Please add an option for "don't know".<br> :date: __2020-09-28 14:41:59__

> All OK here<br> :date: __2020-09-27 11:39:54__

> Buffering and wont open since last update. okay once finally open but not every day. I use data majority of time, not wifi.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 17:26:47__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="2_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 2 reviews"/>
</p>

> Confusing and being forced through pages every day that have already been read.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 12:34:32__

> For fuller coverage, this should be available for PASSIVITY<br> :date: __2020-09-25 15:35:23__

> I think the daily survey should ask more than just how you're feeling. Weight etc may change over time.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 12:13:25__

> Having previously donated cash to this project I have now uninstalled it. Being threatened with a £10,000 fine for failing to comply with a flawed PCR test has lost my interest.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 11:21:03__

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Saturday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 12:25:55__

> Great idea, but...Why do they ask for so much personal info that does not relate to COVID? Thought it would be quick & easy (I'm sure it is after asking & answering several questions about my Aunt Flo & other questions) I un-installed.<br> :date: __2020-09-19 13:56:05__



#### 1-star reviews

> It won't let me creat an account and isnt giving me and error message as to what the issue is<br> :date: __2020-10-02 04:58:51__

> I downloaded this app a few days ago and it has now stopped working. I'm unable to find out why this is or what to do about it.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 19:12:32__

> I'm not going to sin in with an email address.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 00:39:30__

> Poorly designed. Doesn't always work. Won't let me fill in forms sometimes. Also can't possibly provide useful results if it can't even distinguish between a posive antibody test and a positive Covid test. The whole app also feels like it wastes my time. It has never once provided me with any useful information in exchange for my inputting my information daily.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 17:44:28__

> How about a link to the data being produced? An on line per capita summary would be in order. Otherwise the app is pure Trumpish bull.<br> :date: __2020-09-23 14:09:34__

> No longer get a daily reminder to log my status. Notifications are turned on and I have uninstall and reinstalled the app but still no reminders. (Samsung Galaxy S10)<br> :date: __2020-09-22 09:12:46__

> Waste of time and energy, go jump<br> :date: __2020-09-21 14:58:42__

> Behaves normally when offline, however data is silently discarded. It would be easy to lose data accidentally. App should report an error if data cannot be uploaded.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 10:34:24__

> As soon as i installed it, i was getting reminders even after i entered my data. It got too annoying. Im disappointed in the app cuz i thought it would be helpful but its not when itll take my info more than once a day.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 22:20:35__

> Could not install on my samsung a50. It says its installed but there is no icon to click on and no way to get into the app or uninstall. Useless I'm afraid which is a great shame as I would like to help with this pandemic if I can.<br> :date: __2020-09-19 09:33:33__
