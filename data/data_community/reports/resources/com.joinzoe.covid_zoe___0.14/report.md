### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Do I need a notification every three hrs? No didn't think so. Uninstall.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 23:13:03__

> - App doesn't work with enlarged text so my partner who is registered blind is struggling. - I can't record previous symptoms even though FAQ says you can when you sign up. - My home screen just tells me to report my symptoms for the day even though I've already done that. - I can't review my own info. - Can't find contact email address for queries. I'll stay on the app for science but wouldn't it be more useful to gather my previous symptoms? Also pls sort out access!<br> :date: __2020-07-13 13:11:56__

> Downloaded easily but wouldn't open on my phone just kept saying I wasn't connected?<br> :date: __2020-07-18 14:44:43__

> Doesn't work. Says I am offline. Retrying... And never works.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 23:27:59__

> I think it's important to help where needed however your reporting is outdated and convolutes the message about what is happening. It's obvious infection rates are slowly rising but the regional graphs are no longer shown. Figures are not telling the picture acurately any longer due to time lag. It's July 17th and cases in my area show up till July 11th. How is it that people report daily and you can't?<br> :date: __2020-07-17 12:55:42__

> Have an experia phone and I dont think this app works for me.. Cant get past the profile questions so sorry to say Its not working. Getting tired of filling in my date of birth etc each time I use it. Didnt work on my ipad either tho... Same issue wont go on to next question<br> :date: __2020-07-15 17:29:56__

> It was going well until 11.7.20, when it no longer recognized me. Although I knew my password, I tried saying I'd forgotten it and was repeatedly told that a reset link had been emailed to me. It had not and it wasn't in spam.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 16:45:02__

> app stopped working and does not even open when uninstalled and reinstalled<br> :date: __2020-07-13 04:25:54__

> Downloaded at the beginning on an old phone, but it ended up taking up over 200mb of space the largest app on the device all for answering a couple of questions, makes me wonder what else is up to, so I've deleted it...<br> :date: __2020-07-11 12:05:31__

> Takes up too much data<br> :date: __2020-07-11 11:39:29__

> This app used to prompt me for a status update every day. It doesn't any more. Is this correct?<br> :date: __2020-07-10 20:14:36__
