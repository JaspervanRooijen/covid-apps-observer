### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Ok for 2 weeks, then app terminally failed, just showing blank white screen. Had to reinstall it which is hard as it doesn't come up when searching Play Store.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 13:38:17__

> Was working great, now I can't scroll through the covid tests to select the latest to give results, all you get is the first 3 tests.... I've had 16. Bit pointless having the test part of you can't add the result when you get it.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 15:18:29__

> Ok, but have to input the same info dob, height and weight eveytime.?<br> :date: __2020-10-16 12:01:10__

> Difficulty getting App to work for few days. Had to uninstall and then install again. Does not always seem to register the information I put in.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 15:36:36__

> Can't always move on to next question or page<br> :date: __2020-10-15 13:39:33__

> Does not always log the entries one makes - several times it has told me incorrectly that I have not replied for one or two days. No opportunity for making comments: I wanted to tell it that I had had antibody tests for research purposes (Biobank) but would not be told the results but could not do so - the only option was to record a "failed test".<br> :date: __2020-10-15 13:14:01__

> This app was great, I could log all my tests (regular tests from work) but as of yesterday I've just been getting a white screen? Uninstalled and installed again but still the same..disappointing. Update: I can get back on again, but unable to scroll down my tests to update results :/<br> :date: __2020-10-15 12:12:00__

> Can't seem to edit my last test result. Will only show me the past ones as it won't let me scroll down. I have done 11, only shows 10 though. Have to be tested once a week for work.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 12:07:44__

> Firstly was 5stars. Down to three now as half my tests have disappeared off the app<br> :date: __2020-10-15 11:49:30__

> Was OK but, as with many other people, it now loads a white screen and nothing more.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 10:52:57__

> Rubbish! The app will not move past the test questions. Constantly asks for new test info. Cannot complete the process.I have uninstalled it, that is how I deal with apps that do not work!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 12:01:04__

> Bugs that mean you can't fill things out properly are frustrating. I spent a long time answering multiple questions it was a little unclear that I was supposed to be focusing on pre covid and that there would be a second set of questions but like many friends of mine when arriving at the questions to answer for during lockdown the software froze and I could only exit in the hope I could go back but unfortunately exiting meant I no longer had an option to finish the survey<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:52:09__

> Have been using for months, suddenly stopped loading. Have uninstalled and reinstalled but still get blank white screen.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 09:40:26__

> I kept trying to check in but was given all the registration questions every day, not just the symptom check, which was really annoying. So I reinstalled the app, created a new account and it worked for one day, but now I can't even get into the app, just get a white screen. How is it so broken?<br> :date: __2020-10-15 09:07:27__

> Suddenly stopped working.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 17:08:38__

> What am I missing?? When I click on Report Today in the main screen and I keep getting every day the same exhausting set of general health questions and have to complete my height, weight etc. Where are the questions about COVID-19 symptoms?<br> :date: __2020-10-10 11:07:41__

> App has been missing the last digit off figures for over 2 months now. Sent screenshots to the developer 3 weeks ago but nothing has changed. E.g. 234 cases in my area show as 23.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 23:41:52__

> Confusing and being forced through pages every day that have already been read.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 12:34:32__

> For fuller coverage, this should be available for PASSIVITY<br> :date: __2020-09-25 15:35:23__

> My partner has a problem with the app (which is up to date) on her Motorola phone. After only 3 reported tests the screen is not showing any more as the available space has been filled, it just shows the "Is this list correct" button at the bottom and the "Add new test" at the top of the list. It won't scroll to show the other tests she's added or the new one she just added and there's no way to reduce the font size to get more in. It's stressing her out HELP<br> :date: __2020-10-15 09:19:25__

> I've used it for weeks, now it will not go further than showing the logo, then blanc screen. Tried reinstall and restarts of phone.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 08:48:11__

> App has stopped loading, just getting a blank white screen.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 08:32:15__

> Can no longer get app to load . Tried reinstalling but get white screen and won't progress further. Its been working fine up until now. Galaxy note 9<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:00:41__

> Once past the login screen, only get a white screen. Have cleared cache and data, with no joy, so rendering the app useless<br> :date: __2020-10-15 02:41:47__

> Worked ok for a while, then just stopped - white screen, nothing happening. Needs sorting as it's a good idea.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 20:44:12__

> This has been working perfectly for 6 months. Until today. All I'm getting is it saying loading, and then I get a white screen. I've tried clearing my cache, logging out and in again, even uninstallng and installing again and nothing will cure it. Anybody know what is wrong and how to cure it? Help!<br> :date: __2020-10-14 18:23:02__

> Not accurate. I live in an area which has had really low numbers but this app is identifying my area as 5000+ a month. In reality <800 in total since the start of the pandemic. I have now deleted my data and will uninstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 22:34:47__
