### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Quick and easy way to support Coronavirus research. Painless and professional.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 02:13:06__

> Very easy to use ðŸ˜€. Like to feel I'm doing something which is real, rather than all the misinformation that's come from the government.

> Easy to use, well explained<br> :date: __2020-08-23 13:30:30__

> Too bad it can't be downloaded if you don't have an UK Google account, even residing in UK and being duly registered with the NHS. Tried downloading the apk and install it but it doesn't work either. I have to connect through my partner's smartphone. Hence 4* instead of 5 for this absolutely indispensable app<br> :date: __2020-08-23 12:33:17__

> Easy but so far taking 15 -30 mins a day<br> :date: __2020-08-22 22:36:28__

> I have been submitting my health repoort every day for the passed three weeks. Two days ago all I got was ' loading' but nothing more. I am told that the app is installed and my device is compatible. So what do I do to continue. I think that the app is an excellent way to report individual health quickly and easily. In return I can follow all the progress re spread, data and developments on vaccine and medication. I would like to continue, but am not able to. Please help.<br> :date: __2020-08-22 17:49:12__

> Easy to use and its helping the fight<br> :date: __2020-08-22 17:18:57__

> I would have liked an option to say that I had symptoms before they were recognised as symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-08-18 08:31:14__

> Doesn't seem to work properly nor open correctly. Hence I'm not using it very often. Then when open it there is always long questionnaire. Never just symptoms and go as I had expected.<br> :date: __2020-08-15 08:39:50__

> Was great at first. Now it will not let me provide my symptoms as I do not know my blood type and it wants to know that before I can do anything.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 17:55:46__

> Are you kidding me . RATE IT<br> :date: __2020-08-10 02:03:00__

> Wont let me enter details about myself. Something went wrong error when submitting gender, year of birth, postcode<br> :date: __2020-08-07 18:19:35__

> I can't get past the About Me page. It says something went wrong try again later.<br> :date: __2020-08-07 02:52:32__

> Too late to report recurrent symptoms I first had months ago before lockdown<br> :date: __2020-08-03 20:33:24__

> Have had this app since March or early April. I report every single day since installation and never had issues until about 2 months ago. The problem is that now, everyday, it has been directing me to report on days that I have already reported. It's as annoying as a fly that won't go away. I sent an email and only received a form letter in return. I'm trying to do my part but will stop and uninstall if not resolved soon.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 23:16:50__

> Easy to use... nothing asked is too private... Recently: Constantly says "Loading..." under logo, so have to delete app. data & re-sign in to enter a response to questionnaire !!!<br> :date: __2020-08-23 12:18:10__

> Where has the daily updated view of the data for app users gone?<br> :date: __2020-08-21 22:47:23__

> Why a create an account. Too many apps want too many details before they deliver.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 09:27:16__

> The 2 reasons I installed this app is: 1) to help you 2) to be informed about how many cases of covid are in my area each day. YOU said you would give that info. You have failed to do your part so I see no reason why I should continue with your studies. I am deleting the app and you will not hear from me again.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 08:48:40__

> After updating the app no longer gives you local information. Used to be i gave them something (daily reporting) and in return they gave me something (local covid info). I wi be uninstalling<br> :date: __2020-08-21 01:44:28__

> No reassurance it is worth it<br> :date: __2020-08-21 00:01:44__

> This app was working fine on my phone for about 3/4 weeks and has now stopped. I've uninstalled it and installed it again but each time it takes me to the sign in screen followed by select country and then back to sign in again. I've rebooted my phone but it's still not working.<br> :date: __2020-08-16 11:50:59__

> Starting to cause trouble. Notification that wont desappear and when completting diet questions not allowing me to submit.<br> :date: __2020-08-11 17:02:51__

> App is stuck in the about you section.<br> :date: __2020-08-11 10:03:08__

> Unable to complete registration: the website freezes. I've given up wasting my time going through the same futile questionnaire day after day. Uninstalled the app.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 13:12:40__
