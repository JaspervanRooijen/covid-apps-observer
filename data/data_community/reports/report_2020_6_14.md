# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

| <img src="resources/com.joinzoe.covid_zoe___0.14/icon.png" alt="COVID Symptom Study icon" width="40"/> | COVID Symptom Study


The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

| **Supported Android version**  | Varies with device |

### Description
> This is the first version of the app, currently available for Isle of Wight residents only. If you develop symptoms of coronavirus and report them in the app, the NHS COVID-19 app will anonymously warn those that you have been near to. They will receive advice from the NHS on the right action to take to stop the virus spreading further. This means that people can be quickly encouraged to self-isolate before they become infectious, allowing the country to stay one step ahead of the virus.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

> A worthy cause. App is generally easy to use, but not super easy.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 19:25:14__

> The app works OK. I am running it on an Android emulator on my PC as I don't have a smart phone. It would be more convenient to have a Windows version.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 15:10:36__

> The app was easy to install. The only slight problem was that I was using an out of date version which didn't update automatically. So I had to uninstall the old version and install a new one.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 12:18:04__

> Really easy to use and contributes to Covid 19 research. I am amending my review as I have been experiencing a problem. I use this app every day but I am not sure if all my responses are getting through. When I go to enter my info it says I haven't reported, eg today it says my last report was 3 days ago and yesterday it said my last report was 4 days ago!<br> :date: __2020-06-14 10:39:22__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-06-13 17:09:24__

> App is very simple to use but the reminders seem to be be intermittent, it would be great to be reminded each day to report in.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 16:07:38__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-06-13 15:42:49__

> Great idea and I'm happy to contribute daily data. But app keeps showing notifications to check in when I already have and pressed Done. It would be nice to have some feedback over time to help keep up the "streak" of reporting, otherwise starts to feel a little useless sending data about how not sick I am into the void. It would be great to have an opt in button for contact tracing.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 16:43:50__

> Fel like I am contributing in a small way. . Feel more info could be added. But good idea.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 17:40:37__

> I've just started using the app again. I had to re-register because I changed my email provider and couldn't change it on here.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 14:36:20__

> Would like to see level of out breaks in local area not county. Seem very general at the moment eg 10 in Chester.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 08:01:14__

> I've had to reinstall three days in a row. Was fine until the<br> :date: __2020-06-12 18:21:24__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-06-12 14:42:03__

> Easy to use, though covid free up to now.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:12:13__

> Very easy to use, but hasn't reminded me to report every day in spite of having notifications switched on<br> :date: __2020-06-10 16:37:15__

> The questions are quite limiting<br> :date: __2020-06-09 20:51:30__

> It keeps dropping out<br> :date: __2020-06-08 23:14:41__

> App ok, but uses space on already nearly full phone. Just had to remove it and deleat some photos again.<br> :date: __2020-06-14 10:23:20__

> It would be better if this had tracking so we all know who is safe and who isn't.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 18:05:09__

> Downloaded but will not open to do anything. Maybe it's the area<br> :date: __2020-06-10 14:48:56__

> Is this the app the government want us to install, I've seen so many?<br> :date: __2020-06-07 22:13:53__

> Good idea but bad user experience. Unnecessary clicks by asking every single day if you've been tested for the virus. Also the arrival screen (the blue one with the button to report is) is messy.<br> :date: __2020-06-07 15:50:07__

> Hold lot of junk mail since got this. Avoid !!<br> :date: __2020-06-05 17:25:30__

> App was working when we entered dailey report. The last two days, when we logged on, it showed that we had already reported our status?<br> :date: __2020-06-04 10:33:56__

> The app worked very well for weeks but has now crashed. A message comes up that the Covid Symptom Study has stopped. Is this due to the latest update on 8th June?<br> :date: __2020-06-13 19:58:55__

> Took twenty minutes to provide all my information, including health, travel, shopping, work etc. AFTER all that it asks for an email address and password. It THEN asks for the same information all over again. I don't have 40 minutes spare to install ONE app.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 13:57:37__

> They started by asking two simple questions wich I didn't mind then they increased these to be intrusive and personal so just deleted the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 13:53:24__

> Doable and easy to comprehend<br> :date: __2020-06-13 10:23:46__

> Not all that good<br> :date: __2020-06-13 07:13:40__

> hard to find out where to enter data<br> :date: __2020-06-11 10:13:50__

> Tried 3 times to use this app. Each attempt took me through about 4 sets (pages) of questions before stalling and going no further; every time stopping at the same point and not responding when I clicked 'next question'. After 3 attempts I uninstalled the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-10 18:53:42__

> Since the update 9th June the app won't open<br> :date: __2020-06-10 11:46:38__
